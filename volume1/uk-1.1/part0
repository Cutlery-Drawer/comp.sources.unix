Well, with all this recent discussion on sendmail, I guess its time to 
advertise my sendmail configuration "package" with which it is possible to 
make a configuration file without writing one sendmail rewrite rule!

It has the following features:

    +	Input addresses can be in any of the following forms:

	822 style:	@domain1,@domain2:user@domain3
	Percent style:	user%domain3%domain2@domain1
	uucp style:	domain1!domain2!domain3!user

	Mixed addresses are handled giving '@' & '%' precedence over '!'.
	(This is usually the best bet).

    +	Domain information can be included in a table format, e.g.

		hwcs		hwcs.uucp
		cstvax		cstvax.ed.ac.uk

	This maps addresses such as jim@hwcs to jim@hwcs.uucp.

	There is a shell script which "compiles" this to sendmail rules
	and classes.

    +	Routing information can be included in a table format, where the
	format is dependant on the mailer, e.g. the uucp mailer table
	has the following format:
		domain			uucp route

	e.g.
		hwcs.uucp		kcl-cs!hwcs!%s
		cstvax.ed.ac.uk		ucl-cs!cstvax!%s

	The ethernet mailer has the format:
		domain			host-to-forward-to
	e.g.
		bina.wisdom.bitnet	bina
		deya.wisdom.bitnet	wisdom

	Top level domain relaying can also be specified, e.g.

		csnet		csnet-relay.arpa
		dec		decwrl.arpa

	There is a shell script which "compiles" all this to sendmail rules
	and classes.

    	It supports the following mailers: uucp, ethernet, janet, bitnet


    +	It allows several hosts to be "hidden" from the outside as one
	site.

    +	An improved rmail interface to sendmail (e.g. sets the sender macro)
	and an improved "damail" sendmail interface for the rscs bitnet software

    +	Finally, it copes with Janet, where addresses are in little-ending
	form, and Received headers are replaced by Via headers.
	There are janet/sendmail interface programs available.

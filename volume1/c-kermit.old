UUCP and Kermit access to the complete Kermit distribution is available from
the Department of Computing and Information Sciences, Oklahoma State 
University, Stillwater, Oklahoma.

- UUCP -

You need to set up "okstate" as a site in your "L.sys" UUCP dialing file
using the information listed below.  You can then issue the following 
command on your system:

	uucp okstate\!/u/kermit/cp4\* /usr/spool/uucppublic

   (this example will retrieve the CP/M version of Kermit)

"/usr/spool/uucppublic" was chosen as the destination on your system since
the destination must be WIDE OPEN (drwxrwxrwx) to everyone.  You should
not remove files from your uucppublic until the entire transfer is complete
including any redials that are necessary.  If you do remove some files,
our system may retransmit them, resulting in a higher phone bill for
you. 
 
There are 2 files available that contain information about the entire
distribution.  We recommend that you retrieve these files first.  They
are "00readme.txt" which explains the file name conventions used, and
"00directory" which is a complete listing (by name) of all files in the
/u/kermit directory.  These files will enable you to choose the right files
the first time to save those high dollar phone bills.

---- UUCP Login information ----

Site Name    :  okstate
Phone number :  (405) 624-6953  (one line only)
Login name   :  uucpker
Password     :  thefrog
Hours        :  24 hours per day, 7 days a week
Problem      :  okstate!uucp-support  (UUCP)
  reports    :  uucp-support%okstate@csnet-relay  (ARPA)

The phone number is for 300/1200 baud (bell compatible).

The following is a sample L.sys line (\r is a carriage return).

okstate Any ACU 1200 405-624-6953 "" \r ogin: uucpker word: thefrog

Just a few notes on how to best retrieve parts of the Kermit distribution
using UUCP...

  -  Install the proper L.sys entry and test it using the debugging option
     of UUCICO (-x).  Repeat this step until you successfully complete a
     "no work" connection, this will verify that your L.sys entry is correct
     and will minimize frazzled nerves.

  -  Retrieve the files `00readme.txt' and `00directory' with the following
     commands:

          uucp -c -d okstate!/u/kermit/00readme.txt /usr/spool/uucppublic
          uucp -c -d okstate!/u/kermit/00directory /usr/spool/uucppublic

     You will have to escape the exclamation point if you are using the
     C shell (i.e. ...okstate\!/u/kermit...).

  -  Choose the versions of Kermit that you wish to transfer and issue the
     proper UUCP command.  Some systems don't seem to like wildcards, but
     in any case the wildcards will have to be escaped from your shell. The
     following command would retrieve the files relating to C-Kermit:

          uucp -c -d okstate!/u/kermit/ck\* /usr/spool/uucppublic

     PLEASE NOTE THE USE OF /usr/spool/uucppublic!  Unless you *really* 
     understand how UUCP's protections work you should not change this!  A
     number of people have queued >100 files and had their systems refuse
     to store them in out of the way places.  This results in wasted phone
     time!

KERMIT SERVER ACCESS TO THE KERMIT DISTRIBUTION AREA.

Okstate also provides access to the KERMIT distribution via a KERMIT Server.
The number is the same as above for the uucpker login, so the line may be busy
quite a bit.  This server is a specialized server with controlled access.  At
present, the server is only allowed access to the /u/kermit directory on our
machine.  By issuing the command  "REMOTE HELP"  from your KERMIT, you will see
a description of the commands that the server will recognize, and a line like

-> /u/kermit: r

This means that the server can read files from the directory /u/kermit.  Other
possibilities exist, there is w-Write access, d-Delete access, and x-Execute
access.  At any rate, you can only read from the /u/kermit directory at this
time, and it is the only directory that you may access.

KERMIT login   :   kermsrv
Password       :   piggy
Parity         :   even
Data path      :   7 bit
Available      :   24 hours/day, 7 days a week

When the login is completed, the server will start, and you should escape
back to your local KERMIT to issue further commands.  If the server remains
idle for a period of time around 10 minutes, it will be stopped.  While the
server is receiving data other than NAK packets, it will continue to run.

The best place to start after logging on is "REMOTE HELP", followed closely by
the desired "REMOTE DIR" commands.  If you don't include an argument to REMOTE
DIR, you should be prepared for more than 600 lines of output.  It is usually
better to read the 00README.TXT file (using REMOTE TYPE perhaps) and then do
the DIR with some kind of wildcard (like "REMOTE DIR ck*").

Patch #: 31
Priority: LOW
Subject: Number of new articles arriving is miscalculated
From: tonyb@tektools.UUCP (Tony Birnseth) [sort of]

Description:
	When new articles arrive, rn prints a message telling the user how
	many new articles have arrived.  ("nn new articles have arrived!")
	The count is incorrect.

Repeat by:
	Wait till this event occurs and the number of new articles reported
	will be the sum of the old number of articles + the new ones that
	have arrived instead of the difference between the new count and
	the last know high numbered article.

Fix:	First of all, if you applied the patch Tony sent out, unapply it.
	patch -R should do what you want.  Then apply the following patch.

	From rn, say "| patch -d DIR", where DIR is your rn source directory.
	Outside of rn, say "cd DIR; patch <thisarticle".  If you don't have
	the patch program, apply the following by hand, or get patch.

	If patch indicates that patchlevel is the wrong version, you may need
	to apply one or more previous patches, or the patch may already
	have been applied.  See the patchlevel file to find out what has or
	has not been applied.  In any event, don't continue with the patch.

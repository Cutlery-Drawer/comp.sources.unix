System: rn version 4.3
Patch #: 40
Priority: HIGH
Subject: moderated groups work differently now
From: lwall@sdcrdcf (Larry Wall)

Description:
	As part of the newsgroup renaming scheme, moderated groups will no
	longer be of the form mod.*.  In order that users know when they
	are in a moderated group, rn should say whether a given group
	is moderated.

	Additionally, the code in Pnews to handle moderated groups is now
	obsolete, since inews handles it.
	
Fix:	To fix Pnews to be compatible with 2.11 inews, just remove your
	/usr/lib/news/moderators file, or equivalent, if you have one.
	If you haven't installed 2.11 yet, leave your moderators file there
	until you install 2.11, which will be soon. (!!!!)

	To fix rn, install the following patches and recompile.

	From rn, say "| patch -d DIR", where DIR is your rn source directory.
	Outside of rn, say "cd DIR; patch <thisarticle".  If you don't have
	the patch program, apply the following by hand, or get patch.

	If patch indicates that patchlevel is the wrong version, you may need
	to apply one or more previous patches, or the patch may already
	have been applied.  See the patchlevel file to find out what has or
	has not been applied.  In any event, don't continue with the patch.

	If you are missing previous patches they can be obtained from me:

	Larry Wall
	{allegra,burdvax,cbosgd,hplabs,ihnp4,sdcsvax}!sdcrdcf!lwall

	If you send a mail message of the following form it will greatly speed
	processing:

	Subject: Command
	@SH mailpatch PATH rn 4.3 LIST
		   ^
		   notice the c

	where PATH is a return path FROM ME TO YOU in bang notation, and LIST
	is a list of one or more patches you need, separated by spaces, commas
	and/or hyphens.  Saying n- will give you everything from n on up.

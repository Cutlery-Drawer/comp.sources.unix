X   The installation script and these following procedures must be
X   executed by the superuser.
X
X1. cd to ISPIN.rel_2.2/ISPIN/h
X   Edit the file localcnfg.h
X   Edit the SITELINE constant definition to reflect the name of your site.
X   Modify ONLY what is between the asterisks, keeping the overall width of
X   the line the same as what is already there.
X
X2. cd to ISPIN.rel_2.2/ISPIN/install.
X   Edit the file "Makefile" and make sure the SPOOLER is set to the proper
X   value -
X
X         ZILOGNQ, since your system is a Zilog which uses the nq spooler 
X
X   Execute the command "make" to compile all of the C programs which are
X   used by ISPIN.
X
X3. You are now ready to install the C programs which were just compiled.
X   Take a look at the program "install.sh" to make sure your are comfortable
X   with what it does. Now, execute the command "make install" (make will execute
X   the program install.sh).
X
X4. Copy the executable ../obj/iq to a directory to which your users have
X   a path for execution ( such as, generally, /z/bin ).
X
X5. Make provision in your system start-up script(s) (i.e., /etc/rc_csh)
X   to invoke /usr/spool/queuer/ISPIN/iqueuer (the daemon) every start-up.
X   Execute it now, just for the first start-up.
X
X6. Edit your system's startup and (if any) re-start script(s). The
X   names of these scripts vary, but will almost always be something
X   like "/etc/rc", "/etc/rc_csh", "/etc/rc2". You get the idea. These
X   scripts usually also invoke other scripts along the way. Find the
X   point at which the script gets rid of "old" lock files (files
X   with names like "/usr/spool/uucp/LCK..tty*"). Usually the line
X   in the script says:
X                                 rm -f /usr/spool/uucp/LCK..tty*
X
X            CHANGE IT TO READ:
X                                 rm -fr /usr/spool/uucp/LCK..tty*
X
X   The reason for this change is that the lock files ISPIN creates
X   are actually directories. Adding the "r" flag to the rm(1) arg
X   list permits the removal of any such lock files which remain on
X   the system subsequent to an unexpected or otherwise ungraceful
X   shutdown.
X
X7. Choose the tty(s) through which ISPIN will contact printer(s).
X   Releases 2.0 (and later) of ISPIN support lock files.
X   The tty(s) you choose may be used for other purposes like cu(1) and
X   uucp(1) as well as support of the ISPIN printer(s). You may, however,
X   support several such printers via one or more tty(s).
X   Also refer to your SA manual. As with any other port which supports
X   a printer, if the tty had previously been in use as a login port,
X   the getty must be permanently disabled.
X   Don't concern yourself with whether the tty is ttyconfig as "modem"
X   or as "terminal". ISPIN handles all tty settings itself. 
X
X   ISPIN does, however, cooperate quite well with uugetty. So if you 
X   have a need for bi-directionality (as I do with my little AT&T 3B1)
X   ISPIN is ready to oblige.
X
X8. Connect tty(s) to network. Have your Data Communications Specialist
X   do this while you read ALL of the documentation which came with this
X   release.
X
X   Seriously, I can't make specific recommendations for every possible
X   combo of cpu/data switch and printer/data switch. I will make a strong
X   general recommendation that you connect all valid modem control
X   signals. Don't try to fool the cpu or the switch by feeding their own
X   modem control signals back to them. If you do this, you'll make your
X   data communications less reliable, less fault-tolerant.
X
X   IN GENERAL: If the cpu is DTE and the data switch is DCE and you're
X   using RS-232 25-pin "D" connectors, the pinning will be 1 through 8
X   and 20, all straight through. If your cpu's ttys are DCE (and switch
X   also DCE), you'll need null modem adapter or null modem pinning. Zilog
X   ttys are DCE.
X
X   Some switches do end-to-end modem signal mapping and the pins on which
X   certain signals are listened-for and asserted-upon are different from
X   "normal" RS-232. For some switches, this can also vary depending upon
X   how a given channel is configured.
X
X   Most switches I've seen or heard of (Tellabs, Equinox, David, Gandolph,
X   Mitron, etc) allow channels or groups of channels to be configured to
X   support software flow control, XON/XOFF. ISPIN needs this at both the
X   cpu and printer sides. By the way, the less-expensive "dumb" Equinox
X   which merely passes XON/XOFF from end-to-end with no internal buffering
X   is not adequate (you'll lose characters due to flow control problems).
X   The more sophisticated Equinox is fine.
X   
X   Our X.25 asynchronous pads allow this to be set "on the fly", during a 
X   connect session. Under this facility, we can turn on software flow control
X   via ISPIN's rtab entry for printing, and turn off software flow control 
X   from uucp's L.sys (or Systems) entry to allow uucp "G" protocol. 
X
X9. Connect printer(s) to network. Be sure to configure your printer(s) for 
X   software (XON/XOFF) flow control. Disable hardware (CTS/DTR) flow control.
X   The same goes for all links in your network hardware (the ports or
X   channels to which the cpu and printer are connected).
X
X   Some printers allow XON/XOFF flow control to be enabled or disabled,
X   but they won't let you disable hardware flow control. I'm thinking
X   specifically of the HP LaserJets, but there may be others. In these
X   cases, you'll have to disable hardware flow control through creative
X   pinning. In my case, the printer is DTE, my X.25 async pad is DCE, and
X   all signals are asserted-upon/listened-for on what we consider "normal"
X   RS-232 pin positions. Most of my pad-to-printer cables are straight
X   1-8 & 20. My cable for the HPLJ has pins 4 & 20 swapped.
X
X
X10. Edit the /usr/spool/queuer/ISPIN/rtab to add a line of
X   connect info for each remote printer. If you have some experience
X   setting up a uucp L.sys (or HoneyDanBer's Systems) file, rtab
X   should be a snap.
X
X   The directory ISPIN.rel_2.2/ISPIN/install/lib_rtab contains a
X   README file. READ IT!
X
X   The rtab file supplied with this release includes extensive 
X   comment lines as documentation. Don't delete them. The rtab also
X   includes commented-out printer entries as examples. Take a look.
X   It's pretty straight-forward once you weed out the \p's and \d's.
X   Most of what I'm about to describe is also included in rtab's
X   comments. There are many IMPORTANT details included in rtab but
X   not addressed here.
X
X   Notice that each entry is all one line. As you add an entry for your
X   printer(s), allow the line to wrap around. Line feed or carriage 
X   return terminates the entry. I have made no provision for escaping 
X   newline with a backslash.
X
X   Leading # comments-out the entire line. (Do not use blank lines.)
X
X   The first field is the name by which the printer will be known.
X   I strongly suggest that this be same as the name by which the
X   dqueuer knows the queue member via /usr/spool/queuer/config.
X   You'll see shortly why I can only strongly suggest but not enforce
X   this policy via ISPIN. Use the same name to save yourself and 
X   others from any possible confusion. Your choice of printer name
X   is thus restricted to what is allowable under the dqueuer regime.
X   See your SA manual under "Configuration File Description".
X
X   The second field defines the serial port(s) through which ISPIN
X   may attempt to contact the printer. You chose these in item 6,
X   above. This entry specifies primary and subsequent ports,
X   separated by commas. A one port entry is just as acceptable.
X   Eleven ports is max.
X
X   The third field specifies the speed setting for the port.
X
X   The "-B" flag & arg fields define portions of various "network
X   busy" messages which may be encountered when ISPIN attempts
X   to negotiate through the network. In the case of one example, 
X   because we are calling out from the cpu, into a Tellabs data
X   switch, then out into the X.25 async pad, I have included unique
X   parts of "busy" messages from both the Tellabs and X.25 async pad
X   environments. The usage of the "-B" flag and arguments is, like
X   the other two flags, optional. 
X
X   I VERY STRONGLY suggest that your rtab entries include as many
X   of these "busy" flags and args as you can possibly identify. They
X   add immeasureably to the robustness of the application. Otherwise,
X   the ISPIN won't be able to re-attempt contact of a network-supported
X   printer which is currently being used by another ISPIN from the
X   same (or different) cpu, or (heaven forbid) by an MDQS process,
X   or which is otherwise busy for whatever reason. All looping which
X   occurs under these conditions is strictly under the control of
X   the ISPIN and the IQUEUER. The native lp spooler has no idea any 
X   re-try is going on. Of course, the native cancel command may terminate
X   the ISPIN at any time.
X
X   A "-I" flag and argument field defines a portion of a 
X   network message which would be encountered when/if the line, the
X   destination device, or some intermediate device is just plain dead.
X   Define "-I" flags only for messages which indicate network conditions
X   under which you would prefer that the requested print job simply
X   give up and terminate itself. 
X
X   I personally would prefer my jobs to re-try even under such conditions.
X   The looping algorithm for the "-B" cases described above is not
X   going to cause your system to thrash. So I say "let 'em loop".
X   You or the user who requested the print job should eventually notice
X   things are not moving along. If the job is looping, you'll have an
X   opportunity to correct the network problem or other problem and
X   never lose a print request. Of course, if network conditions are so
X   bad that you know the ISPIN will never get through, the job may be
X   terminated by the native cancel(1) command.
X
X   The arguments to the "-D" flags are unique protions of strings which
X   are messages we expect the network(s) to return when/if the printer
X   is powered-down or disconnected. After each burst of characters which
X   is written by ISPIN to the printer, ISPIN checks the port to see if 
X   there are any characters to be read. Normally there will be none.
X   If, however, the printer has been powered-down or otherwise disconnected,
X   we expect the network device to recognize the situation and give us
X   a message. If we have correctly specified parts of these messages as
X   args to the "-D" flags, the program will immediately detect the "disconnect"
X   situation and loop, attempting to re-establish contact with the printer.
X   Once the connection is re-established, the job will be printed in its
X   entirety. Since the letter "e" is the most frequently used letter in
X   the alphabet, I'll usually have a "-De" field. This way, if we're
X   disconnected from the printer and all the chars we send out are being
X   echoed back to ISPIN, we'll detect the error condition very quickly.
X
X   The "-Q" fields define, in sequence, what signals or 
X   messages should be issued to the network to accomplish a clean break
X   at the end of a successful connect session. Let your knowledge of 
X   your own local switch (if applicable) be your guide. What
X   do you have to enter at your keyboard to assure a clean break?
X   For the moment, ignore the \p's (1 sec pause) and \d's (3 sec delay).
X
X   In one example, remember, we went from cpu, to Tellabs, to X.25 async pad,
X   to the printer. Now to disconnect, we conduct a clean break of each
X   virtual connection under our control.
X   The first "-Q" argument is "\K", which rtab's documentation tells us
X   results in the issuance of a <BREAK>. This is the signal X.25 async pad needs
X   to put the printer's channel into command mode.
X   The next "-Q" argument is "clr" and carriage return, a readily recog-
X   nizable X.25 async pad command which drops the virtual connection.
X   The next two "-Q" flags and arguments issue <BREAK>bye to the local
X   Tellabs data switch. This is my locally defined disconnect sequence
X   for the Tellabs data switch in Indy.
X
X   Before we proceed to a discussion of the EXPECT and SEND sequences,
X   I'll explain the necessity for all of the pauses and delays. In my
X   testing, I found that when ISPIN is running on a lightly loaded cpu 
X   and conversing with the X.25 async pad, the program is capable of shifting
X   between writing to the network and reading from the network MUCH
X   faster than the network is capable of responding. Before long, the
X   EXPECT/SEND sequence gets lost. Rather than "hard code" the necessary
X   delays into the application, I chose to allow the specification of
X   pauses and delays by the user (you). This approach permits the greatest
X   amount of flexibility in implementation. Experiment for yourself.
X   Also, many printers need time to print the contents of their buffers
X   after all characters have been issued by the cpu, but before the network
X   connection is dropped. Increasing delay time in the first "-Q" sequence
X   is the answer. If the last several lines of a document are being lost,
X   try adding a "\w" or "\L" immediately after the first "-Q" flag.
X   If you need more or less pause or delay, adjust your rtab entry.
X
X   Now for the EXPECT/SEND sequences.
X   EXPECT and SEND are pairs.
X   You must begin with EXPECT.
X   You must end with a null SEND field.
X   The best way to figure out what you need to say in these sequences
X   is to call out through the port(s) you are using with cu(1).
X   Once you have made a successful connection all the way through to
X   the printer, any subsequent keyboard activity on your part should
X   show up on the printer.
X   In our example, notice the liberal usage of the compound construction,
X   EXPECT-SEND-EXPECT. This construct exactly mimics uucp's similar
X   feature. Use of this feature significantly enhances your chances of
X   making a successful connection.
X   There is a lot more info on rtab in rtab's comments.
X
X   The directory ISPIN.rel_2.2/ISPIN/install/lib_rtab contains a
X   README file. READ IT!
X
X
X11. Creation of a FIFO for each printer in /usr/spool/queuer/ISPIN/FIFO
X    need not be done manually. The application will create a FIFO for
X    each queue member as needed.
X
X    If you observe the example rtab entry, you'll note the printer is
X    named "LSB1". The first time a request is issued to this queue member,
X    the FIFO /usr/spool/queuer/ISPIN/FIFO/LSB1 will be created.
X
X
X12. Add each remote printer as a member of the native queuer by
X    editing /usr/spool/queuer/config. See your SA manual on this topic.
X    After I added my first ISPIN-supported printer, my /usr/spool/queuer/config
X    looked like this:
X
X#
X# first queue ... lpr has the line printer
X#
XQlpr,R,N,S

XDLSB1,R,/dev/null,/usr/spool/queuer/ISPIN/ispin -P LSB1
X# Draft  DP (via PACNET) rm. 428
X
X
X    Two items of note. TWO ITEMS OF SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE.
X
X    note: I added a new queue named "net" to my config file. It is 
X          not necessary that you do this. ISPIN-supported printers
X          may belong to previously existing queues, if you choose.
X    note: Our config file has many comment lines which are used by
X	  our ISPI application. The comment lines have no functional
X          relationship to ISPIN, nor to anything you and I are doing
X          here.
X
X    SIGNIFICANTLY IMPORTANT:
X	  The "device" we have specified in our config file entry for
X          the ISPIN-supported printer "LSB1" is /dev/null. It is VITALLY
X	  IMPORTANT that the native dqueuer does not know the device
X          ISPIN will be using. If you want to know why, dig into the
X          code. I don't want to go into it here.
X
X    SIGNIFICANTLY IMPORTANT:
X          The "backend" (in nq/dqueuer parlance) command line for
X	  /usr/spool/queuer/ISPIN/ispin REQUIRES the "-P" flag and
X	  an argument. The argument MUST BE the same as the first
X          field in the printer's rtab entry (printer name). We need
X          this flag and argument because the printer name is not
X          among the arguments dqueuer passes to the backend upon
X          invocation. ISPIN must, however, have the printer's name
X          in order to find the correct rtab info.
X
X
X13. Force the dqueuer to re-read its config file thus:
X    dqueuer -r
X
X14. Use the new printer.
X    The native nq and dqueuer commands will function exactly normally
X    as they relate to the ISPIN-supported printer(s). xq still retains
X    its control over the life and death of the print job.
X
X15. Also use the iq command to inquire the iqueuer daemon. In an active
X    IQUEUER/ISPIN situation, xq may show several print processes as
X    "RUNNING" simultaneously when you know they can't all possibly be
X    printing simultaneously. This situation could arise when/if several
X    ISPIN-supported members of the native queue have been configured by
X    you to all use the same tty for access out to the network. As far as
X    xq and dqueuer are concerned, once the "backend" process has been
X    invoked, the process is "RUNNING". This is the situation the IQUEUER
X    daemon is designed to accomodate. IQUEUER manages the ISPINs which
X    are competing for the scarce resource. iq will show you which of the
X    ISPIN processes are actually running or are actually waiting.
X
X16. Look to /usr/spool/queuer/ISPIN/log for ISPIN error messages and
X    event logging.
X
X
X        PS: I have a very strong theory on the cause of, and solution for,
X            the Zeus 3.21 dqueuer's major problem. As you have probably
X            observed, the dqueuer can get "locked up". It will continue
X            to accept requests, but refuses to actually issue any jobs.
X            Sometimes you can fiddle around with it and get things moving.
X            Sometimes a reboot is the only "solution". 
X            The cause lies in the "status" reporting by the "backend" 
X            program. See /usr/include/spool.h under Zeus 3.21. The backend,
X            on some regular basis, does an unbuffered disk seek and an
X            unbuffered write to the dqueuer's status file. That alone is
X            enough to negatively impact overall system performance. We
X            already know that the overworked disk drive "zero" is busy
X            enough. Servicing unbuffered disk operations drags it down
X            just that much further.
X            Even worse, and the apparent cause for the "lockups", is
X            the competition for exclusive file locks on specific areas of
X            the status file. If you have ever tried this yourself, you
X            may have found, as I have, that the exclusive file locking
X            procedures aren't too terribly reliable. Deadly embraces often
X            result. Lockup city.
X            The solution is to avoid the whole thing by not having the
X            backend report status (pages, pages done, percent done) at
X            all. 
X            Do yourself, your users, and your system a favor and get rid of
X            backend programs which report their status. The loss of the 
X            status information is a small price to pay for a more robust
X            dqueuer and the relief of system "busywork".
X            The ispin backend does not report status. If you choose, you
X            may even support "hardwired" printers through this application.
X            All it takes is an rtab entry with no optional flags and (one
X            each) null EXPECT and SEND strings.

X
X
X        *** *** *** *** *** *** INTRODUCTION *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ***
X
X        This is the current version of the production release of ISPIN.
X        ISPIN.rel_2.2 differs from the 2.1 release only in its documentation,
X        which has been modified to support a public release of ISPIN.
X
X        To date, ISPIN has been successfully installed and tested on these
X        systems:

X

X
X        
X        This transmittal creates a directory named ISPIN.rel_2.2. 
X
X        ISPIN.rel_2.2 will contain two subdirectories, namely ISPI and ISPIN.
X
X
X        *** *** *** *** *** *** ISPIN subdirectory *** *** *** *** *** *** ***
X
X        ISPIN contains the source code, install documents, and install scripts 
X        for the ISPIN application. The ISPIN application serves as a BACKEND, 
X        a network/printer interface for the native queuer/spooler. ISPIN
X        currently supports the UNIX Sys V lp/lpsched spooler and the Zeus 3.21
X        (Zilog) nq/dqueuer.
X
X        We have organized the directory ISPIN into subdirectories using
X        standard names "doc" (for documentation files), "h" (for header
X        files), "install" (where install scripts exist, and from which they
X        must be executed), "obj" (where the executables will be placed as
X        they are compiled), and "src" (where the source code resides).
X
X
X
X        *** *** *** *** *** *** ISPI subdirectory *** *** *** *** *** *** ***
X
X        The ISPI directory contains the freshest version of our ISPI
X        application. ISPI is an application which serves as a FRONTEND,
X        a user interface, for the native queuer/spoolers. ISPI currently
X        supports the UNIX Sys V lp/lpsched spooler and the Zeus 3.21
X        (Zilog) nq/dqueuer.
X
X        ISPI includes its own source code and documentation. We sent
X        ISPI along because we have found it to be an extremely useful tool
X        to support the native queuer/spoolers. If you have any version of
X        ISPI previous to this one, please use this one as a replacement. The
X        ISPI included with this transmittal supersedes the ISPI which
X        accompanied the ISPIN.rel_2.1 release.
X
X        ISPIN and ISPI are TWO SEPARATE AND DISTINCT APPLICATIONS.
X
X        Neither depends upon the other for functionality. You may use ISPIN
X        without ISPI. You may use ISPI without ISPIN.
X
X
X
X        *** *** *** *** *** *** ISPIN documentation *** *** *** *** *** ***
X
X        The documentation for this application is informal in style, and the
X        code is overflowing with comments. If you don't have time and inclin-
X        ation to read everything in the ISPIN.rel_2.2/ISPIN/doc directory,
X        AT LEAST READ:
X                        TECH.doc, OVERVIEW, and rtab
X
X        Several files in the ISPIN/doc/OLD-DOCS directory document the 
X        design, development, testing, and implementation history of ISPIN.

X
X        We are maintaining a list of sites which use ISPI/ISPIN and of
X        contact persons at those sites. Unless you tell us, however, we will
X        have no idea whether or not you actually use these applications
X        in production. Our hope is that you will, but we will not 
X        presume it. Please confirm installation and usage of ISPI/ISPIN
X        via e-mail sent to me as shown at the end of this document.
X
X        Confirmed users will receive all subsequent update and informational 
X        distributions. We will notify users of updates via an electronic mail 
X        group, also shown below.  If possible, we would like your site to have
X        a user included in this group. An administrative e-mail address which
X        is aliased to an actual user(s) at your end is preferred (i.e.
X        "dat1!sysadm" instead of "dat1!jdoe"). Please notify us of the e-mail
X        address at which you would like to receive ISPIN information.
X
X        There is no bug-free software. Although the alpha site and beta site
X        testing has been extensive, and ISPIN has been in heavy production
X        use for two years, we recognize the possibility of bugs which
X        have not yet been exposed. Please report them to me by electronic mail
X        as decribed elsewhere.
X
X        If you install and use ISPI/ISPIN on hardware/software platforms which
X        are not listed in this memo, please let me know. This software is 
X        intended to be portable.
X
X        If you develop "rtab" entries which you feel others may find useful,
X        share them! Use the e-mail alias "ispinusr". Anything you send to
X        that address will automagically be distributed among all participating
X        ISPIN customer sites. Same thing applies for any other information

X        configs, etc.

X		     Version 1, February 1989
X
X Copyright (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
X                    675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
X Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
X of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
X
X			    Preamble
X
X  The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users
Xat the mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our General Public
XLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
Xsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The
XGeneral Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's
Xsoftware and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
XYou can use it for your programs, too.
X
X  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
Xprice.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make
Xsure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free
Xsoftware, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
Xthat you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
Xprograms; and that you know you can do these things.
X
X  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
Xanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
XThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
Xdistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
X
X  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
Xgratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
Xyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
Xsource code.  And you must tell them their rights.
X
X  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
X(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
Xdistribute and/or modify the software.
X
X  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
Xthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
Xsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
Xwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
Xthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
Xauthors' reputations.
X
X  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
Xmodification follow.
X
X		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
X   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
X
X  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
Xcontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
Xdistributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The
X"Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based
Xon the Program" means either the Program or any work containing the
XProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each
Xlicensee is addressed as "you".
X
X  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
Xcode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
Xappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
Xdisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
XGeneral Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
Xother recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License
Xalong with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of
Xtransferring a copy.
X
X  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
Xit, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph
X1 above, provided that you also do the following:
X
X    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
X    you changed the files and the date of any change; and
X
X    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
X    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either
X    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all
X    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except
X    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all
X    third parties, at your option).
X
X    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
X    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
X    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an
X    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
X    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
X    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
X    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General
X    Public License.
X
X    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
X    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
X    exchange for a fee.
X
XMere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its
Xderivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
Xthe other work under the scope of these terms.
X
X  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of
Xit, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
XParagraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
X
X    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
X    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
X    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
X
X    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
X    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge
X    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the
X    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
X    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
X
X    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
X    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
X    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
X    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)
X
XSource code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
Xmodifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means
Xall the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special
Xexception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard
Xlibraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable
Xfile runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that
Xaccompany that operating system.
X
X  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
XProgram except as expressly provided under this General Public License.
XAny attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer
Xthe Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use
Xthe Program under this License.  However, parties who have received
Xcopies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public
XLicense will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
Xremain in full compliance.
X
X  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based
Xon the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,
Xand all its terms and conditions.
X
X  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
XProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
Xlicensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
Xterms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
Xrecipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
X
X  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
Xof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
Xbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
Xaddress new problems or concerns.
X
XEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
Xspecifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any
Xlater version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions

X	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
X
X  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
Xpossible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it
Xfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
Xterms.
X
X  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
Xattach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
Xthe exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
X"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
X
X    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
X    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>
X
X    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
X    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
X    the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)
X    any later version.
X
X    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
X    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
X    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
X    GNU General Public License for more details.
X
X    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
X    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
X    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
X
XAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
X
XIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
Xwhen it starts in an interactive mode:
X
X    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author
X    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
X    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
X    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
X
XThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
Xappropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
Xcommands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
Xc'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
Xprogram.
X
XYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
Xschool, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
Xnecessary.  Here a sample; alter the names:
X
X  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

X                  production release 1.2
X
X
X
X        *** *** *** *** *** *** INTRODUCTION *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ***
X
X        This is the current version of the production release of ISPIN.
X        The following instructions should be followed by those sites which
X        have not previously installed ISPIN. If you already have ISPIN
X        release 1.1 installed on your system, you should follow the 
X        instructions in the file "UPDATEto1.2".
X
X        June 30, 1989 marked approximately one year since ISPIN was just a
X        gleam in our eyes, and approx nine months since the first keystrokes
X        were struck in its development. Alpha site testing of ISPIN commenced
X        approx December 27, 1988. Beta site testing commenced approx Feb 14,
X        1989. Ultimately, seven sites were actively involved in testing three
X        successive "beta" versions of the application. This is not experimental
X        software.
X
X        ISPIN.rel_1.2 contains all of the functionality and features laid out
X        in our initial analysis and those which were identified and suggested
X        by those beta test sites which actively helped us test. Except for bug
X        fixes, this is the way the application is going to look and work.
X        We are not planning any added features, nor are we soliciting any
X        suggestions for added features. This application is simple, flexible,
X        robust, and adequately functional. We intend for it to remain stable.
X
X        ISPIN has been successfully installed and tested on:
X
X                                     Zilog Model 31

X        Except for conditional compile statements required to resolve the
X        differences between Zeus 3.21's nq/dqueuer and System V's lp and
X        between System V UNIX and UCB UNIX, the source code is the same for
X        all target environments.
X
X        *** *** *** *** *** *** THIS TRANSMITTAL *** *** *** *** *** *** ***
X
X        The tape upon which we have transmitted the application was created
X        in cpio format. cd to a directory in which you want this release to
X        be written, then execute the command:
X                        cpio -iudmvBc < your_tape_drive
X
X        The result of this cpio will be the creation of a directory named
X        ISPIN.rel_1.2. ISPIN.rel_1.2 will contain two subdirectories, namely
X        ISPI and ISPIN.
X
X
X
X        *** *** *** *** *** *** ISPI subdirectory *** *** *** *** *** *** ***
X
X        The ISPI directory contains the freshest version of our ISPI
X        application. ISPI is an application which serves as a FRONTEND
X        for the two queuer/spoolers. The ISPI application is fully self-
X        contained, with its own source code, documentation, etc. We sent
X        ISPI along because we have found it to be an extremely useful tool
X        to support the native queuer/spoolers. If you have any version of
X        ISPI previous to this one, please use this one as a replacement. The
X        ISPI included with this transmittal supersedes the ISPI which
X        accompanied the ISPIN.beta.3 release.
X
X        ISPIN and ISPI are TWO SEPARATE AND DISTINCT APPLICATIONS.
X
X        Neither depends upon the other for functionality. You may use ISPIN
X        without ISPI. You may use ISPI without ISPIN.
X
X
X
X        *** *** *** *** *** *** ISPIN subdirectory *** *** *** *** *** *** ***
X
X        ISPIN contains the source code, install documents, and install scripts 
X        for the ISPIN application. The ISPIN application serves as a BACKEND 
X        for either of two native queuer/spoolers, lp or dqueuer. We have 
X        organized the directory ISPIN and its contents into subdirectories
X        using standard names "doc" (for documentation files), "h" (for header
X        files), "install" (where install scripts exist, and from which they
X        must be executed), "obj" (where the executables will be placed as
X        they are compiled), and "src" (where the source code resides).
X
X
X
X        *** *** *** *** *** *** ISPIN documentation *** *** *** *** *** ***
X
X        The documentation for this application is informal in style, and the
X        code is overflowing with comments. If you don't have time and inclin-
X        ation to read everything in the ISPIN.rel_1.2/ISPIN/doc directory,
X        AT LEAST READ: LPinstall.doc, NQinstall.doc, README.beta.3, design, and
X        rtab.

X
X        If you are installing this application under ZEUS 3.21 and its

X
X        *** *** *** *** *** *** FEEDBACK, please *** *** *** *** *** *** ***
X
X        We are maintaining a list of sites to which we have sent ISPI/ISPIN
X        and of contact persons at those sites. Unless you tell us, however,
X        we will have no idea whether or not you actually use these applications
X        in production. Our expectation is that you will, but we will not 
X        presume it. Please confirm installation and usage of ISPI/ISPIN. We
X        prefer confirmation via mmdf mail sent to "ispin@indy1", but written 
X        confirmation or a phone call will do. Confirmed users of ISPI/ISPIN 
X        will receive all subsequent update and informational distributions.
X        We will notify users of updates via a mmdf electronic mail group, 
X        "ispinusr@indy1".  If possible, we would like your site to have an 
X        user included in this mmdf group. An administrative mmdf address which
X        is aliased to an actual user at your end is preferred (i.e.
X        "sysadm@det1" instead of "jdoe@det1"). Please notify us of the mmdf
X        address at which you would like to receive ISPIN information.
X
X        There is no bug-free software. Although the alpha site and beta site
X        testing has been extensive, we recognize the possibility of bugs which
X        have not yet been exposed. Please report them to us by telephone or by
X        sending mmdf mail to "ispin@indy1". We are committed to supporting this
X        application.
X
X        If you install and use ISPI/ISPIN on hardware/software platforms which
X        are not listed in this memo, please let us know. This software is 
X        intended to be portable, especially among machines which support a 
X        System V UNIX environment. 
X
X        If you develop "rtab" entries which you feel others may find useful,
X        contact us. We'd like to be the clearinghouse for such information.
X        We have plans to implement a software distribution facility for 
X        users of Indianapolis applications.  The establishment of the mmdf 
X        group "ispinusr@indy1" is the first step in the implementation of 
X        this distribution facility. If you have any questions, please
X        feel free to contact Kevin Fannin.

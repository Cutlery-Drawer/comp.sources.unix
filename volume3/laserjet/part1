Enclosed is the shar format source for a ditroff driver that I implemented
for the HP LaserJet.

	XFollowing is a driver (filter, postprocessor?) for getting ditroff
	Xoutput on the HP LaserJet printer. It is by no means a finished
	Xproduct. It still needs a lot of work, partly for cleanup and partly
	Xfor making it really usable.
	X
	XThe major drawback of the filter is that the output is GIGANTIC,
	Xbecause it issues positioning commands for EVERY character. This also
	Xmakes the printing EXTREMELY SLOW.  (but don't get discouraged, it's
	Xstill usable ...)
	X
	XThe only fix to that problem is to use the LaserJet's default spacing
	Xfor characters, and add width tables for troff to handle the different
	Xspacings of the LaserJet. This has the advantage of reducing the output
	Xsize considerably, along with the time required to print it, BUT - you
	Xalso have to settle for the LaserJet's spacing, which is rather wide
	Xand unattractive (*my opinion*).  Also, the width tables I have don't
	Xagree TOO well with vfont - they expect the Sys 5 stuff - so that could
	Xuse some work too.
	X
	XThe 'draw' functions are not implemented in this filter. I was too lazy
	Xto add them since it's a bit of work and I am not using pic for
	Xanything right now, but if you have the 'draw.c' file that came with
	XDWB (or maybe the equivalent from Berkeley, which I don't have) than
	Xyou can do this yourself.
	X
	XThe fonts in rasti10 look nicer than the ones in vfont.  However, the
	Xglyphs are placed in different positions in the font file, so they need
	Xcode tables to drive them. I never got around to adding the code
	Xtables, but if I do I'll make them available.
	X
	XThere is a 'bug' that I haven't fixed yet - the Laserjet barfs on long
	Xpages. It will not take a positioning command to go to vertical 7600,
	Xfor example, even though it's less than 11 inches. I haven't had enough
	Xtime to look into this and find out exactly how much it WILL let me
	Xuse, but instead I massage all my input files to use a page length
	Xof 10 inches ...
	XThis should not be hard to fix, and if you do, let me know about it.
	X
	XMany people asked for the ^S/^Q filter. I have received many responses
	Xtelling me that this can be achieved via the LITOUT bit, and as many
	Xtelling me that it can't be achieved through LITOUT because of a bug in
	Xthe device driver. I have also received a few versions of fixes for
	Xthis problem. I am therefore leaving out this problem, as it seems to
	Xhave been dealt with extensively. If anybody REALLY wants it, drop me a
	Xline and I'll mail it to you (along with all the other proposed
	Xsolutions I received).
	X
	XFinally, I have lost my HP LaserJet to an AT&T 6300 in an adjacent
	Xoffice. Rumors are we are getting an X2700 (II), but financial
	Xdecisions have not been completed yet. Therefore it seems that
	Xenhancements to this filter will not be top priority in the near future
	X(anybody want to donate a LaserJet to an educational institute ? :-)
	X
	XIf you wish to add the width tables yourself, the information is
	Xavailable from Hewlet Packard. Just call them.  If you need any info
	Xfrom me, feel free to contact  me either through the net (uucp address
	Xbelow) or through the phone...
	X
	XAnd just one thing. If you do make modifications/enhancements/etc,
	XPLEASE let me know? send over whatever you have so that we could share
	Xit with the rest of the net?

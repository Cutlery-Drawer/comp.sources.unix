hdiff [-cdmvw] oldfile newfile

Source file compare program.
Yet another source compare program like diff.  This one reports moved lines,
not delete/insert as the UNIX diff does.  The h is in honor of Paul Heckel,
the guy who first wrote about this algorithm in CACM July 1978.

One of c,d, or m should be used to adjust the internal algorithm.
Currently I am playing with the algorithm.

Switches
	-c = use a "count between the start of the other move block and
		the first line in the other file which matched this move
		block" to determine moved blocks [DEFAULT]
	-d = use a "drop" or relative slope to determine moved blocks
	-m = use "mononotonically increasing by one" to determine moved blocks
	-v = verbose (debugging)
	-w = compress white space only on each line before comparison,
		and remove leading white space (remwhite -a option).

(see CACM, April 78, "A Technique for Isolating Differences Between Files",
by Paul Heckel).

Output:
	The output is identical in meaning to the output from UNIX diff,
	except that a "move" command is present here, but not in diff.

DELETES
-------
old d new 		// Single line delete - Old line number 'old' is
			// deleted after new line numbered 'new'
startold,endold d new	// Block line delete - Old block of lines 'startold'
			// to 'endold' are deleted after new line number 'new'

INSERTS
-------
old a new		// After old line number 'old' is new line number 'new'
old a startnew,endnew	// After old line number 'old', new lines numbered
			// 'startnew' to 'endnew'

CHANGES
-------
old c new		// Change one line to one new line.  The old line
			// numbered 'old' becomes new line numbered 'new'
old c startnew,endnew	// Change one line to a block of lines.  Old line
			// numbered 'old' becomes the new set of lines.
startold,endold c new	//  Change a block of old lines to one new line.
startold,endold c startnew,endnew	// Change a block of lines to
			// a different block of lines.

MOVES
-----
old m new		// Old line number 'old' is moved to new line
			// number 'new'
startold,endold m startnew,endnew  // The old block of lines have been moved
			// and the old line numbers have changed.


For DELETES, INSERTS, and CHANGES (but not MOVES) the old line and new lines
are displayed as follows (same as the UNIX diff):
< old line
> new line

BUGS:
	Hdiff is limited to files with at most 5000 lines per file.
	To fix, recompile hdiff.c with a larger MAXLINES #define.

/*
 * f=hdiff.c  (In honor of Mr Heckel, the guy who thought up this
 * algorithm).
 *
 * author - dennis bednar  8 22 84
 * Source file comparison program similar to UNIX diff, except this
 * version outputs moved blocks whereas UNIX diff reports it as
 * delete/add blocks.
 *
 * Algorithm from "A Technique for Isolating Differences Between Files"
 * CACM, April 1978, by Paul Heckel.
 * Some ideas for pass 6 were borrowed from "What's The Diff? -- A File
 * Comparator for CP/M", Dr. Dobb's Journal, August 1984, by D.E. Cortesi.
 * The borrowed idea was that when you are at the beginning of two
 * blocks of lines which link with lines in the other file, but don't
 * match, then the smaller ascending block is the "moved block".
 *
 * The pass5a () is coded directly from his his pass5 Pascal procedure.
 * It doesn't work if the old line being looked up in the symbol table
 * isn't unique!!!  You would have to change the format of the linerec
 * record to make it work.  That's why it's commented out.
 *
 * Output

DELETES

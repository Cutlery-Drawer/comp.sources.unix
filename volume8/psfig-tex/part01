psfig/TeX -- include PostScript (and Macintosh) figures inside a TeX document.


Psfig/TeX is a new macro package for TeX that facilitates the inclusion
of arbitrary PostScript figures into TeX documents. Figures are automatically
scaled and positioned on the page, and the proper amount of space is reserved.
Custom characters may be created and used freely throughout a document. Since
the Macintosh drawing applications produce PostScript, they can be used to
create figures.

\begin{sales pitch}
The most appealing feature of psfig/tex is its clean user interface;
whenever possible assumptions are made about where the figure should go and
what size it should be, so the user need not explicitly specify anything but
the name of the figure. Psfig/tex searces the file for it's bounding box 
comment to find its natural size if the size is not specified, or in order
to scale it evenly (if the user only specifies a height or a width but not
both). The figure is always placed at the current TeX pen position, and 
the PostScript enviornemnt is the "standard" (ie non-dvips) one. Of course,
all default actions may be overridden in a reasonable way. Lots of options.
\end{sales pitch}

System Requirements:
Right now dvips (from TextSet or ArborText or whatever they are calling
themselves this week) is the only supported postprocessor. Porting
to dvi2ps hasn't yet been done, but should not be difficult. 


**> Psfig/TeX is available via anonymous ftp at linc.cis.upenn.edu (10.4.0.96
and 128.91.2.8). <** (see below for uucp)

The main shar files are pub/psfigtex.shar.[1-4] (110K); a full PostScript copy
of the documentation is in pub/psfigtex.ps (~0.8MB); some expensive figures
used in the documentation but not included in the shar file are in 
pub/figs/fancyimage.ps and pub/figs/psfig.ps.1 (about a half meg combined).

If you don't have the expensive figures and run off a copy of the
documentation, the figures will come out in draft mode (just a filename,
no figure). Since these two figres are roughly 4 times as large as all 
the other figures, source, and text combined, I kept them separate.
The full PostScript copy has the expensive figures.

horror stories, comments, suggestions, sucess stories, and other assorted
trivia can be sent to trevor@grasp.cis.upenn.edu or linc.cis.upenn.edu.

X===========
Xpsfig/tex -- include PostScript (and Macintosh) figures inside a TeX document.
X
XFeatures:
X	simple, clean interface
X	psfig automatically positions the figure at the
X		current pen position
X	figures can be scaled easily
X	implemented as a TeX macro package; has been brought up under
X		unix and VMS.

XFrom the abstract of the documentation (sans figures, of course):
X=================================================================
XPsfig/tex is a new macro package for TeX that facilitates the inclusion
Xof arbitrary PostScript figures into TeX documents. Figures are automatically
Xscaled and positioned on the page, and the proper amount of space is reserved.
XCustom characters may be created and used freely throughout a document. Since

X
XSystem Requirements:
X====================
XRight now only dvips (from TextSet or ArborText or whatever they are calling
Xthemselves this week) is the only supported postprocessor. Porting
Xto dvi2ps should be easy, trivial for a good subset of psfig's features.
XI plan to tackle dvi2ps sometime in the future, but if anyone out there
Xhas a good knowledge of what the PostScript environment under dvi2ps looks
Xlike and a spare day, I'll be glad to show what has to be changed.
X
X
XRoadmap:
X========
Xdoc/ :
X	contains the tex source to the documentation
Xman/ :
X	contains a man page (and a cleartext copy for non unix types)
Xsrc/ :
X	tex and postscript source for psfig/tex
X
X
Xquestions, comments, and complaints to trevor@grasp.cis.upenn.edu
X
Xdisclaimer:
X===========
XI have an interest in keeping this thing working and I'll try to clean
Xup any bugs, but there are no guarantees, and I am not interested in spending
Xtime getting psfig to run under foreign OS's. 
X
XFeel free to adapt psfig to any particular application; however please
Xretain the authorship notices, and send me a copy of any neat improvements.

XAdvice on debugging psfig/tex problems:
X--------------------------------------
X
XIn the ideal world, document debugging tools would be paid the same attention
Xas program debugging tools. In the real world, this is not the case, yet with
Xpackages of ever increasing sophistication such as TeX debugging a docuement
Xis becoming no less problematic that debugging 'C'. Having experience in 
Xsuch matters I would say debugging 'C' (or most other programming enviorments)
Xis much more conducive to retaining one's sanity.
X
XAnyway, with proper care and feeding psfig will grow up to be a well used
Xtool in your bag of tricks. It can be eased through the problem years with the
Xfollowing hints on common problems:
X-----
X
Xif a document crashes (stops printing and flushes the job) on or about
Xa figure, the figure probably has some illegal postscript in it, or
Xuses macintosh calls and the prolog was not properly loaded. Finding
Xthe offending command by reading the error message from the printer or
Xusing an error trapping utility is critical. Either use the error
Xhandler distributed to the laser-lovers board some time ago, or
Xmoniter the errors coming back from the printer. If the offending
Xcommand is "psu" you can bet your mac prolog is missing. Check for
Xproblems with page reversing and psglobal (they dont mix well)
X
Xif a document stops printing at some random point (but may continue to
Xaccept data) the printer memory may have been exceeded (VMErrors).
XThis usually becomes a factor on papers exceeding twenty pages (using
Xour installation). Use the printer memorysize option to dvips to
Xremedy this; the optiumum value is not yet known -- I use 60000 for
Xour laserwriter when I run into trouble, and it usually gets me out of
Xthe woods. Some people have had rather severe problems printing the
Xdocumentation and have had to limit memory to <20000.
X
Xif a figure consistantly comes out at the same place on the page despite
Xpsfig's valiant attemps to move it about, it is probably using the clippath
Xto decide where it should print. Use the clip option (see the manual)
X
Xif a figure is comming out out of position, it may be that the bounding box is
Xin error, test the bounding box by printing the figure alone and using a ruler
X
Xand last, but not least,
Xa lone psfig in a centering enviornment will be ignored by LaTeX; try
Xpreceeding it by a hard space or some similar hack.

X\section{Introduction}
XThe \TeX\ typesetting system is a powerful tool in the preparation of the 
Xwritten word, yet when the time comes to add figures or pictures to a document,
Xone traditionally had to resort to tedious manual paste-up. 
XWith the advent of the \Ps\ page description language,
Xwhich allows the `nesting' of environments and is rapidly becoming
Xa {\it de facto} standard, it is now possible to merge graphics
Xdirectly into a document. psfig provides the facility for the
Xnested inclusion of a \Ps\ figure in a \TeX\ document.
X%
X\par
X\section{Including a figure}
XTo include a \Ps\ figure with psfig, simply load the psfig macros at the 
Xbeginning of your document with
X\par
X{\tt\verb+\input{psfig}+}
X\par
Xthen invoke the macro
X\par
X{\tt\verb+\+psfig\{figure={\it input}\}}
X\par
Xwhere {\it input} is the name of a \Ps\ file. 
Xpsfig will automatically position the figure at the current place on the page, 
Xand reserve the proper amount of space in \TeX\ so that it doesn't conflict
Xwith any other objects.
X\par
XFor example, if we have a file called `piechart.ps' which contains the
X\Ps\ code to draw the chart in the abstract, and it was the first figure
Xin our non-page reversed document, we would use the commands
X\begin{quote}
X{\tt\verb+\+input psfig } \\
X{\tt\verb+\+centerline\{\verb+\+psfig\{figure=piechart.ps\}\}}
X\end{quote}
XSince no mention of size was made in the above example, psfig draws the figure 
Xat its natural size (as if it was printed directly on 
Xa \Ps\ printer.) The pie's natural size is several inches across, which
Xis a little large; the pie in the abstract was produced with:
X\par
X{\tt\verb+\+centerline\{\verb+\+psfig\{figure=piechart.ps,height=1.5in\}\}}
X\par
XThe {\tt height} option specifies how tall the figure should be on the
Xpage. Since no {\tt width} was specified, the figure was scaled equally
Xin both dimensions.
XBy listing both a {\tt height} and a {\tt width}, figures can be scaled 
Xdisproportionatly, with interesting results.
X\par
XFor example:
X\par
X\centerline{\hbox{
X\psfig{figure=figs/rosette.ps,height=.8in,width=.15in}
X\psfig{figure=figs/rosette.ps,height=.8in,width=.35in}
X\psfig{figure=figs/rosette.ps,height=.8in}
X\psfig{figure=figs/rosette.ps,height=.8in,width=1.2in}
X\psfig{figure=figs/rosette.ps,height=.8in,width=1.5in}
X}}
X\par
Xwas produced with:
X\begin{quote}
X\tt\verb+\+centerline\{\verb+\+hbox\{ \\
X\verb+\+psfig\{figure=rosette.ps,height=.8in,width=.15in\} \\
X\verb+\+psfig\{figure=rosette.ps,height=.8in,width=.35in\} \\
X\verb+\+psfig\{figure=rosette.ps,height=.8in\} \\
X\verb+\+psfig\{figure=rosette.ps,height=.8in,width=1.2in\} \\
X\verb+\+psfig\{figure=rosette.ps,height=.8in,width=1.5in\}\}\} 
X\end{quote}
X\par
X\subsection{Caveats}
XFor psfig to find the natural size of a figure, the figure must have a
Xproper bounding box comment; see section 5 below. Draft mode (also 
Xdetailed below) should be used liberally to speed throughput. 
XAlso, some versions
Xof \LaTeX\ will fail to properly center a lone figure in a centering 
Xenvironment;
Xa good work-around is to precede the figure with a hard space. On very large documents with many figures, the printer memory
Xallocated to dvips may have to be limited. 
X Finally, the
X\verb+\psfig+ macro will be confused by extra white space or newlines in its
Xargument.
X\par
X\section{Generating PostScript}
XBefore you can include a figure, however, you must create
Xthe \Ps\ file that describes it.
XThe most common methods for creating a \Ps\ figure are to 
Xuse either a drawing application such as MacDraw, an image-to-ps or
Xtextronix-to-ps translator, or to 
Xdirectly code \Ps\ by hand. A brief \Ps\ tutorial is included as an
Xappendix.
X\begin{figure}
X\centerline{\psfig{figure=figs/pathtext.ps,height=2in}}
X\centerline{Figure 1. a \Ps\ figure}
X\end{figure}
X\par
X\subsection{Macintosh files}
XUsing a Macintosh (or any other system that supports mouse-based drawing
Xutilities that use \Ps) is one of the easiest ways of creating
Xa figure (figure 2a.)
XMacDraw is the recommended tool, since
Xit produces code that is independent of scaling (as opposed to MacPaint,
Xwhich produces a bitmap of the figure.)
XThere are several known methods of capturing a MacDraw/MacWrite figure
Xin \Ps\ form and transferring to the \TeX\ host; most involve some
Xmucking about with tricky control sequences, one is detailed in the appendix.
X\par 
XMacDraw creates a output file in the form of `QuickDraw' calls, which are 
Xinterpreted as a set of \Ps\ procedures. These procedures are defined
Xin what is called the `macintosh prolog', which must be prepended 
Xto any macintosh file
Xto be sent to the printer.
XThere is a {\tt prolog} option in the psfig  macro to specify a file that
Xshould be prepended to the figure. The name of the prolog is, of course,
Xsite dependent; we have used `/usr/lib/ps/mac.pro'.
XFor example, if you had a file `frog.mac' that contained the macintosh
Xcode to draw kermit (figure 2b), he could be included with:
X\begin{quote}
X{\tt\verb+\+psfig\{figure=frog.mac,prolog=/usr/lib/ps/mac.pro\}\}}
X\end{quote}
X\begin{figure}
X\centerline{
X\vbox{\vss\psfig{figure=figs/lab.ps,width=2.5in}\vss}
X\hss\vbox{\vss\psfig{figure=figs/frogfill.mac,width=2in}\vss}}
X\par
X\centerline{Figure 2a \& 2b: Macintosh figures.}
X\end{figure}
XIf there are many such figures, it is probable that the repeated inclusion
Xof the mac.pro file will cause a significant increase in file size and
Xtransmission time. An alternative method is to load the mac.pro file
Xonce globally, so that it will be available throughout the rest of the
Xdocument. Use {\tt \verb+\psglobal{\usr\lib\ps\mac.pro}+} at the
Xbeginning of your document
Xto achieve this effect. For this to work properly, the \verb+\psglobal+ must 
Xbe before any Macintosh figures, and the final output must not be page
Xreversed.
X\footnote[1]{It is possible to use psglobal in
Xpage reversed document; place it just before the last figure in
Xyour document. This is living dangerously, and you do so at your own risk.}
X\par
X\subsection{Images (ph), plot, and other sources}
XAny program that produces \Ps\ as output can be used for psfig figures.
XFor instance, the {\it ph} program will convert a bitmap image
Xto \Ps\ form and thus can be
Xused to include an image in a document (figure 3.)
X\par
XThere are similar utilities that can convert files from unix plot(5)
Xor Textronix 4014 format into \Ps.
XThe Unix text processor {\it troff} produces \Ps, so one can slice a page
Xout of a Troff document and include it in a \TeX\ paper (figure 4.)
X\begin{figure}
X\psdraft %% delete me for full copy of paper
X\centerline{
X\vbox{\vss\psfig{figure=figs/fancyimage.ps,height=3in,width=2.25in,bbllx=72bp,bblly=72bp,bburx=540bp,bbury=540bp}\vss}
X\hspace*{0.2in}\fbox{\psfig{figure=figs/psfig.ps.1,height=3in,width=2.25in,bbllx=1sp,bblly=1sp,bburx=8.5in,bbury=11in}}
X}
X\par
X\centerline{Figure 3: A bitmap image.\hss Figure 4: Troff in \TeX}
X\end{figure}
XNote that the {\it troff} page was processed by 
Xthe {\it troff} counterpart to psfig, and itself contains two images and several
X\Ps\ tricks. 
X\par
X\section{Draft figures}
XCertain \Ps\ figures (such as large bitmap images being transmitted at
X9600 baud) can tie up a slower \Ps\ device such as an
XApple LaserWriter for quite some time.
XTo circumvent this, a figure
Xmay be printed in draft mode, which will occupy the same space on the
Xpage as far as
X\TeX\ is concerened, but it will just print the name of the file from 
Xwhich the figure is derived, and will not actually include it.
XThe macro {\tt \verb+\+psdraft} will switch into draft mode, and all
Xsubsequent psfig macros will produce draft figures. The macro {\tt
X\verb+\+psfull} will switch out of draft mode. 
X\section{Bounding boxes}
XTo properly translate and scale a figure psfig must know its `natural'
Xposition on the page; this information is present
Xin what is called the {\it bounding box} of a \Ps\ program. The 
Xbounding box is a outer limit to the marks created by a program,
Xand is specified as four coordinates of a rectangle: the lower-left $x$ coordinate
X(bbllx), the lower-left $y$ coordinate (bblly), the upper-right
X$x$ coordinate (bburx), and the upper-right $y$ coordinate (bbury).
XAdobe has defined a convention whereby the bounding box of a program
Xis contained in a `bounding box comment'.
X\footnote[2]{See `Appendix J: \Ps\ File Structuring Conventions' in
X{\it The \Ps\ Language Reference Manual}}
XThis comment, which must be present in any file to be used as a psfig figure,
Xis a line of the form
X\begin{quote}
X\tt \verb+%%+BoundingBox: \it bbllx bblly bburx bbury
X\end{quote}
XAll values are in \Ps\ points, relative to the {\it default}
Xtransformation matrix. The only mandatory \Ps\ convention is
Xthat the first line of the file should begin with the characters
X`\verb+%+!' (a `\verb+%+' begins a comment in \Ps.) A good place for the
Xbounding box comment is as the second line of the file.
X\par
XThere is a {\it bbfig} utility on systems to aid in calculating
Xthe bounding box, refer to the {\it bbfig(l)} manual page for further information.
X\section{Advanced topics}
X\subsection{psfig internal structure}
XIn including a figure, the {\tt \verb+\psfig+} macro performs the following
Xoperations:
XFirst, if bounding box information (see below) is omitted from the list
Xof arguments, the
Xfile containing the figure
Xis searched and the information recovered from the bounding box
Xcomment. Then,
Xif both {\it height} and {\it width} are missing they are computed to
Xbe the height and width of the bounding box. If only one is missing,
Xit is set to be the appropriate value such that there is no distorted
Xscaling.
XIf {\it rheight} or {\it rwidth} (see below) is missing it is presumed to
Xbe the same as the height and width.
X\par
X The {\tt\verb+\+psfig\{figure={\it input}\}} macro
Xuses a vbox in \TeX\ to reserve the space.
XThe actual inclusion of files is preformed with a  
X{\tt \verb+\+special} command to the {\it dvips} postprocessor.
XPresently, {\it dvips} is the only supported post-processor,
Xbut it shouldn't be to difficult to port psfig to
Xa different postprocessor, presuming similar capabilities and/or
Xaccess to source code.
Xpsfig depends on certain \Ps\ function calls; these are downloaded
Xwith the \verb+\psfiginit+ macro. Do not use page-reversing on your
Xoutput if you are manually initializing psfig with \verb+\psfiginit+, or
Xare using \verb+\psglobal+.
XIt is possible to include these
Xdefinitions into the standard dvips (or whatever) header file; this
Xhas been done on our systems and users need not do a 
X\verb+\psfiginit+.
X\subsection{Reserved size}
X\psfig{figure=figs/box.ps,rheight=0bp,rwidth=0bp,height=1.25in,width=\textwidth}
XThere are two sizes associated with each psfig figure: the size
Xat which it is to be printed on the page
Xand the size it reserves in \TeX. This latter size is appropriately
Xtermed the {\it reserved size}, and is expressed as clauses of the form
X``{\tt rheight={\it dimen}}''
Xand ``{\tt rwidth={\it dimen}}''. If ommited, the reserved size defaults
Xto the real size. Some special effects need to be transparent
Xto \TeX\ and thus have a zero reserved size, such as the grey
Xbox enclosing
Xthis paragraph.
X\subsection{Clipping}
XNormally a \Ps\ program can be expected to not mark the page 
Xoutside its bounding box. If this is not the case, or if you
Xwant to use the bounding box to isolate part of a larger figure,
Xthere is an option that sets the \Ps\ clip path so that
Xno marks will show up outside the declared bounding box. Currently
Xthis is invoked by adding a clause of the form ``{\tt clip=}''.
XHere a slice has been taken out of the pie chart in the example by
Xspecifying a smaller bounding box and adding the clip option.
X\par
X\centerline{\psfig{figure=figs/piechart.ps,height=2in,bbllx=306bp,bblly=396bp,bburx=486bp,bbury=546bp,clip=}}
X\par
XSome \Ps\ programs use the clipping path to position their output on
Xthe page; if a figure is being drawn at its natural size and position
Xdespite psfig commands to the contrary, it may need the clip option.
X\par
X\subsection{\Ps\ environment}
XThe \Ps\ environment within psfig is fairly robust. All of the
Xusual \Ps\ operators will operate as desired; in particular 
Xthe operators `showpage', `initgraphics', and `defaultmatrix' will
Xall behave consistently inside a figure, except that `showpage' will
Xonly do an `initgraphics' and will {\it not} print or erase the current
Xpage.
X\par 
XIt is very possible, however, for a \Ps\ program to bypass the psfig
Xenvironment and disrupt a document. These cases are infrequent,
X and a `work-around' solution can usually be found.

X\section*{Appendix A: \Ps\ Overview}
XCoding \Ps\ by hand gives you the most control possible over the 
Xshape and appearance of the figure; for example, few conventional document
Xpreparation packages could produce the graphic in figure 
X\Ps\ is a stack-oriented language, very similar to Forth and RPN in the way
Xthat arguments are handled, yet it features strong typing and higher
Xlevel control structures. It has an advanced imaging primatives, based on a
X{\it stencil and paint} imaging model. Objects are rendered on the
Xpage by applying {\it paint}, which can be any color or sampled image,
Xthrough a {\it stencil}, a closed geometric path that limits where the
Xpaint should go. For example, a line can be described as applying black paint
Xthrough a long thin stencil. This generality is preserved throughout \Ps, 
Xincluding in its treatment of fonts, but that does not prevent \Ps\
Ximplementations from taking advantage of special cases for efficiency
Xconsiderations. Rarely would an actual \Ps\ interpreter draw a line
Xby creating a thin rectangle and performing a fill operation;
Xwhat is important is that its
Xbehavior can be perfectly characterised as if it had.
X\par
X\Ps\ has a full complement of data types, operators, and control structures.
XIn general, arguments are pushed on an operand stack, then popped off and acted on by an operator
Xor procedure. When \Ps\ encounters an object it can't execute immediately
X(such as a number or a string),
Xit is pushed onto the operand stack. Thus, to provide parameters to an
Xoperator, simply list them before the operator name. Thus \Ps\ (like
Xforth), is a prefix language. All expressions are thus unambiguous, and
Xthe syntax is very efficient to interpret.
X\par
XFor instance, arithmetic is easy:
X\begin{quote}
X\tt 2 2 add
X\end{quote}
Xwould leave a `4' on the operand stack. Similarly, to add
X$\frac{1+2}{2+3} + 13 * 9$, you would type
X\begin{quote}
X\tt 1 2 add 2 3 add div 13 9 mul add
X\end{quote}
X\par
XIn addition to numbers and operators there are several different types 
Xof objects that \Ps\ supports. A string, for instance, is denoted by
Xtext enclosed in parenthesis. An array of objects is denoted by
Xbrackets, and a procedure by braces.
XAn identifier that is not a number, string, or composite object
Xis a {\it name} object. There are two types of name objects, {\it
Xexecutable}, meaning the value or procedure associated with the object will
Xbe evaluated immediately, and {\it literal}, which is not evaluated.
XA literal name has a `/` prepended to it,
Xand is pushed directly on the operand stack, while an executable name is
Xlooked up on the {\it dictionary stack}, and its associated value placed
Xon the operand stack. 
XA {\it dictionary} is a data
Xstructure that associates {\it key} - {\it value} pairs.
XAll operators, variables, and procedures are referenced through the
Xdictionary stack, which essentially establishes the hierarchical naming
Xenvironment in \Ps.
X\par
XThere are always at least two entries on the dictionary stack: the system dictionary and
Xthe user dictionary. The system dictionary contains all the bindings for the
Xbuilt-in operators, while the user dictionary holds user variables and
Xprocedures. A \Ps\ program is free to modify the user dictionary (and to
Xadd new entries on the stack), but can not write to the system dictionary.
X\par
XAssigment is with the {\tt def} operator, which takes a literal name and value
Xand stores it in the topmost dictionary; to initialize $\pi$ you
Xcould say
X\begin{quote}
X\tt /pi 3.14 def
X\end{quote}
XAfter this {\tt def}, typing the executable name {\tt pi}
Xwill cause \Ps\ to look up that name in the dictionary stack and place 3.14 on the operand stack. 
X\footnote[3]{The value need not be numeric; it may be a string, array, or procedure, among other things.}
XFor instance,
X\begin{quote}
X\tt pi r 2 exp mul
X\end{quote}
Xwould evaluate $\pi r^2$ (of course, if {\tt r} had not been 
Xdefined, an error would have been generated).

X\end{figure}
XThe \Ps\ language has a rich collection of operators, including
Xthe usual stack operators (pop, dup, exch, ...), arithmetic operators (add, mul,
Xsin, ...), and control operators (if, loop, for ...), as well as 
Xmore advanced operators
Xfor manipulating dictionaries, arrays, strings, and files. 
X\par
XWhile \Ps\ has all the capabilities of a general purpose language, it 
Xis first and foremost a page description language,
Xand as such has a whole range of operators that manipulate 
Xthe graphics state and place marks on the page. 
XAll values given to graphic primitives in \Ps\ are transformed through the 
X{\it current transformation matrix (CTM)} before any marks are made on the
Xpage. Thus the CTM establishes the scale and orientation of the coordinate
Xsystem in which a program will run.
XThe default \Ps\ CTM produces a coordinate system in \Ps\ points (\Ps\ points
Xare the same as `big points' (bp) in \TeX - 72 to the inch)
Xwith the origin in the lower left hand corner of the page.
XThe CTM can be scaled, rotated, or translated dynamically
Xby a \Ps\ program.
X\par
XAn important object in the graphics environment is the {\it current
Xpath}, an internal \Ps\ data structure that keeps
Xtrack of geometric shapes. The current path is composed of an arbitrary number 
Xof connected or disjoint line segments, curves, and Bezier cubics. 
X\par
XThe {\tt newpath} operator clears the current path, and 
Xthe {\tt moveto} operator will move the current point to an arbitrary location.
X{\tt Moveto} takes two arguments, an x and y location on the page,
Xso to move to (307,397) you would say {\tt 307 397 moveto}.
XExactly where (307,397) is on the page depends on the CTM; with the
Xdefault matrix, it is roughly at the center of the page.
X\par
XFrom the current point, an {\tt x y lineto} will add a line
Xsegment to {\it (x,y)} on the current path, or
Xa {\tt closepath} will add a segment back to the first 
Xpoint in the path.
XTo create arcs and circles, a {\tt x y r ang1 ang2 arc} will
Xadd a counterclockwise segment from {\it ang1} to {\it ang2} of a circle of
Xradius {\it r} whose center is at {\it (x,y)}.
XNote that none of these commands actually
Xmark the page; they just build up the path structure.
XTwo operators which will mark the page according to the
Xcurrent path are:
X{\tt stroke}, which will draw a line along the current path, and
X{\tt fill}, which will paint the region enclosed by the current path.
XFigure one depicts a sample \Ps\ program and its result.
X\par
XText can be equally as simple; first, you must set up the current font.
X\begin{quote}
X\tt /Times-Roman findfont 10 scalefont setfont
X\end{quote}
Xwould set the current font to be ten point roman.  
XA string can be printed at the current point using the {\tt show} operator.
XIn \Ps\, strings are delimited by parenthesis.
X\par
XWhen a \Ps\ program has completed putting all useful marks onto a page,
Xit should execute the 
X{\tt showpage} operator, which causes the printer to print and eject the current page.
X\par
XThus, to label the vertices in our triangle, we could modify our 
Xprogram as follows
X\begin{quote}
X\tt newpath \\
X50 50 moveto \\
X150 50 lineto \\
X100 150 lineto \\
Xclosepath stroke \\
X/Times-Roman findfont 10 scalefont setfont \\
X45 55 moveto (a) show \\
X155 55 moveto (b) show \\
X95 55 moveto (c) show \\
X60 35 moveto \\
X(The Triangle ABC) show \\
Xshowpage
X\end{quote}
Xwhich would produce:
X\par
X\psglobal{figs/mac.pro}
X\centerline{\psfig{figure=figs/trianglev.ps}}
X\par
XThis overview was only meant to give a flavor of the \Ps\ 
Xlanguage, and therefore has only touched on the simplest 
Xof it's commands. For a more thorough introduction, 
Xconsult the {\it PostScript Language Tutorial and Cookbook}
Xand {\it PostScript Language Reference Manual} from Adobe Systems.

X\section*{Appendix B: Capturing \Ps\ files from a Macintosh}
XIn general, a \Ps\ file can be transferred from a Macintosh to another host
Xusing any of the popular terminal emulators and a serial line. We have used
XMacTerminal and Kermit without any problems.
X\par
XSlightly trickier is getting the \Ps\ into a file on the Macintosh. For
XMacDraw and MacWord (and perhaps others), there is an undocumented
X``feature'' whereby the \Ps\ code can be diverted into a file rather than
Xbeing sent to a printer. Immediately after clicking `ok' from the print
Xmenu, hit clover--F; the code will be placed in a file with the name 
X``PostScript'' (there is no known way to change this). Clover-K will 
Xcapture the file {\it and} the lengthy prolog mentioned above.

X					    % This program prints a rosette
X					    % design by defining a section of
X					    % that design and printing that
X					    % section repeatedly. This program
X					    % illustrates the ``for'' and
X					    % "arc" operators, and it shows
X					    % how coordinate transformations
X					    % can be nested so as to use the
X					    % most convenient coordinate
X					    % system for each part of a
X					    % design.

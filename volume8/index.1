Subject:  v08INF1:  Mod.Sources Index and Archives
Newsgroups: mod.sources, net.sources
Approved: mirror!rs

Mod.sources: Volume 8, Info 1
Archive-name: index.1

This is the first of two introductory messages about mod.sources.  This
one describes how to submit source to mod.sources, where the archive
sites are, and how to contact them.  The companion articles lists all
previously-published mod.sources articles.

I am always looking for suggestions on how to improve the usefulness
of mod.sources, and can be contacted as listed below.

	       SUBMITTING SOURCE FOR PUBLICATION

Items intended for posting should be sent to mirror!sources; requests
for missing copies or other queries should be sent to
mirror!sources-request.  In Australia, Robert Elz is a "sub-moderator";
people there can work with him (kre@munnari.OZ) to get postings out
more easily.

If you want verification of arrival, so say in a cover note, or at the
beginning of your submission, if it is small.  I try to verify that a
program works, and if I can't get it to work, I may hold up posting it
for a couple of days.  Please note that, except in rare cases, source
without documentation and a Makefile will not be published.

When you send mail, MAKE SURE to include a return address relative to
some well-known site(s).  When all else fails, my conventional address
and phone number are:
	Rich $alz
	Mirror Systems
	2067 Massachusetts Avenue
	Cambridge, MA  02140
	617-661-0777

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
		THE STRUCTURE OF MOD.SOURCES ARTICLES

Each posting in mod.sources is called an "issue"; there are 100 issues
to a volume.  The division is arbitrary, and has varied greatly in the
past.  There are two types of articles in mod.sources; sources and
"information postings."  They can be distinguished by the subject
line:
	Subject:  v07INF8:  Index for Volume 7 and other info
This first word in the title identifies this as the eight info posting
in volume seven.  Similarly, the subject line shown below:
	Subject:  v07i071:  Public-domain MAKE
identifies this as the 71st source article in Volume 7.  Large sources
are broken up into smaller pieces, and have subject lines that look like
this:
	Subject:  v07i043:  2.11 News Documentation and Conversion, Part03/08

The first few lines in an article are auxiliary headers that look like this:
    Submitted by: caret@fairlight.oz
    Mod.sources: Volume 7, Issue 71
    Archive-name: make
The "Submitted by" is the author of the program.  If you have comments about
the sources published in mod.sources, this is the person to contact.
When possible, this address will be in domain form, otherwise it will be
a UUCP path relative to host mirror (my machine).

The second line repeats the volume/issue information for the aide of NOTES
sites and automatic archiving programs.

The Archive-name is the "official" name of this source in the archive.  Large
postings will have names that look like this:
    Archive-name: patch2/Part01
Please note try to use this name when requesting that sources be mailed
to you.  Also, note that the "part number" given in the title, and the
archive name given in the auxiliary header need not be identical.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
		    ACCESSING THE MOD.SOURCES ARCHIVE

The complete mod.sources archives are fairly large:
	Volume	  Size (Kbytes)
	  1	      4004
	  2	      1204
	  3	      3434
	  4	      4220
	  5	      390
	  6	      4220
	  7	      3976

There are several active archive sites around the net.  I am particularly
interested in helping set up a BITNET archive.  No word yet on the
European archive.

When you request something before Volume 6, please make sure to be as
descriptive as possible as articles before then do not have official
names.

Several sites below will send tapes through the mail.  For those sites,
send a 1/2" mag tape WITH RETURN POSTAGE and RETURN MAILER.  Tapes
without postage or mailer will not be returned.  No other methods (COD,
etc.) are available; please don't ask.

Finally, please note that I am Rich $alz, rs@mirror; Rick Adams is
rick@seismo, and Rich Kulawiec is rsk@j.cc.purdue.edu; we appreciate
the extra effort to get our names right. :-)

1.   Phil Burdi has an archive on-line; contact usenet@cuae2.ATT.COM for more
     info.  He has also set up an off-hours UUCP login providing anonymous
     UUCP access to the archives.  The Systems file (L.sys) entry looks like:
     (for HoneyDanBer UUCP users)
	     cuaepd Wk1830-0530,Sa,Su ACU 1200 3129643773 in:--in: pduucp
     (for Old UUCP users)
	     cuaepd Any1830-0530 ACU 1200 3129643773 in:--in: pduucp
     Retrieve the file cuaepd!~/netnews/mod.sources/howto.snarf and follow the
     directions therein.

2.   Pyramid Technology has an archive arranged topically, and in compressed
     tar files.  They are happy to take new UUCP connections.  They are also
     somewhat willing to make tapes for people to come by and pick up,
     provided you call WELL in advance and bring lunch money.  This is being
     managed by Claudia Dimmers and/or Carl Gutekunst.  Contact
     pyramid!usenet for more info.

3.   Robert Elz (kre@munnari.OZ) keeps mod.sources in different ways
     depending on his available disk space; contact him for more info.

4.   Thos Sumner at UCSF will respond to requests for material, but cannot
     promise an ongoing commitment.  Anyone requesting material via mail
     should supply a path from ucbvax.  Anyone requesting tape should
     contact me first.  Contact him at thos@cca.ucsf.edu, or
     ucbvax!ucsfcgl!cca.UCSF!thos

5.   Tom Patterson at Washington University can make 800/1600/6250 BPI
     tar tapes.  If you give him a "real good reason," he can also make
     1600 BPI VMS BACKUP or ANSI tapes.  Send your tape, mailer, and postage
     to Tom at:
	     Engineering Computer Lab, Bryan 509
	     Lindell & Skinker Blvd
	     Washington University
	     St. Louis, MO 63130
     For best results, first send mail to wucs!archive (you stand a better
     chance of getting processed quickly that way).

6.   Jim Thompson (otto!jim) can make 1600 and 6250 tar and cpio tapes,
     as well as VMS backup in a real pinch.  He will also provide a
     temporary UUCP login for interested parties at 1200 or 2400 baud.
     His postal address is:
	     Jim Thompson
	     2551 Green Valley Pkwy
	     Henderson, Nv. 89015
	     (702) 454-4636

7.   Of course, I have a complete set of archives.  I can mail individual
     postings, make files available for UUCP, and will send tapes (1600
     BPI tar; 6250 or cpio in a crunch).  Last time I checked, it cost
     about $3 to send a 2400' tape across the country in a padded envelope
     via first-class mail.

8.   Rick Adams (rick@seismo.CSS.GOV) provides archive access to those on the
     Internet.  Access is available directly via anonymous FTP (Outside of
     9am-7pm EST M-F.) The files are in a directory mod.sources, then a
     sub-directory Volume[1-7]. They are named as closely as possible to the
     names in the Index.  Files that have not been assigned a "short name"
     reside in the directory sources/mod temporarily.  Send tape, mailer,
     and postage to Rick at:
	 Center for Seismic Studies
	 1300 North 17th Street, Suite 1450
	 Arlington, VA 22209-3871

9.   Internet sites may also retrieve archives from j.cc.purdue.edu via
     anonymous ftp.  The archive is in the directory "mod.sources",
     subdivided into "volume1", etc.  Due to disk space considerations,
     many of the sources are compressed; these may be recognized by the
     ".Z" suffix.  If you don't have compress & friends, they are in
     ~ftp/pub/compress.shar for the taking.  This is being managed by
     Rich Kulawiec (Wombat), pucc-j!rsk, rsk@j.cc.purdue.edu.  If your
     host tables don't grok "j.cc.purdue.edu", try "purdue-asc.arpa".
     They would appreciate it if you would avoid large file transfers
     in the middle of the day.  Rich also points out that the FTP'able
     archies also contain mod.amiga, a bunch of kermit sources, news
     2.11, rn 4.3, nntp, and whatever else happens to be in ~ftp/pub at
     the moment.]

10.  The CSNET CIC has been doing a fair amount of work to bring their
     automated retrieval up-to-speed.  They now have a complete archive,
     and are making things available as quickly as possible (they have
     special legal restrictions on what they can distribute, so everything
     may not be available).  Look in the latest issue of the CSNET Forum,
     or contact postmaster@sh.cs.net.

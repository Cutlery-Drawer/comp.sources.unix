Sigh...  One minor bit of unfinished business was overlooked in the build
changes, and of course neither of our test systems gave any trouble on it.
Some systems, however, will object, and build will fail as it is starting
to construct doit.bin.  The quick fix is to look for "xxx" in build and
just delete it.  Here is the definitive fix, which takes out the -s option
and some related sludge in doit.bin, because the to-subst-or-not-to-subst
decision is now made more sensibly by make.

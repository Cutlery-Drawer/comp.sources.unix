What follows is a newer version of my change-sun-hostid package.

This version is considerably more flexible than the last version 
posted to comp.sources.unix and also serves to illustrate techniques 
for loading system calls into the Sun OS 4.1.x and 5.3 kernels.

Four different approaches to the problem of "changing" the hostid
are provided:

1. Using LD_PRELOAD to "fool" dynamically linked executables.
2. Modifying the in-core image of the kernel so that all processes on 
   a running Solaris system will see a different hostid via 
   gethostid/sysinfo. 
3. Building a new kernel or dynamically loading modules into a running 
   kernel so that certain processes will see a different hostid, which 
   can be set using a new system call. 
4. Reprogramming your NVRAM so that you really have changed your hostid.
   (Be very careful and read all the warnings before you try this).

As with the previous version, please don't use this to steal software 
or violate your licence agreements. This package is intended to make
the life of a sysadmin easier, in the short term, when systems break.
It is not intended to facilitate or encourage theft.

I've been distrbuting this version for a couple of months via ftp, 
and haven't received any bug reports. So I hope that it is fairly 
stable. Please send bug reports to markh@wimsey.bc.ca, and I'll do my 
best to come up with a fix. 

Plans for the next version, which won't be out for at least six 
months due to stuff going on in my personal life, include facilities 
to spoof host names and IP addresses under certain circumstances. It 
will also include an improved user-interface to make this 
functionality more accessible to the novice sysadmin.

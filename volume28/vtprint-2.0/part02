X
X
X
X
X
X1.1. What is vvttpprriinntt?
X
X
X
X     vvttpprriinntt is a program that makes it possible  to  obtain
X     seamless  printing  from  a remote host to a printer at
X     home without  requiring  a  TCP/IP  connection  to  the
X     remote  machine  or  root access on the remote machine.
X     It will communicate over a serial  line  or  a  regular
X     network  connection.   Other  methods of connection may
X     also be possible.
X
X     vvttpprriinntt runs on the remote system (currently only UNIX-
X     like  systems  are  supported).  Software on your local
X     machine may vary considerably.
X
X
X1.2. Who writes/supports vvttpprriinntt?
X
X
X
X     The author of vvttpprriinntt is Garrett D'Amore.   He  can  be
X     reached at <garrett@sciences.sdsu.edu>.  He is actively
X     supporting vvttpprriinntt users, and is working on new  devel-
X     opment with vvttpprriinntt.
X
X
X1.3. Where do I get vvttpprriinntt?
X
X
X
X     The  original  source  archive for vvttpprriinntt is available
X     via ftp.  The current version (as of June 19, 1994)  is
X     2.0  and  can be found at ftp.sdsu.edu in //ppuubb//vvttpprriinntt//
X     as    a    GNU    ggzziipp    compressed    tar     archive
X     (vvttpprriinntt--22..00..ttaarr..ggzz).  Currently, only a source distri-
X     bution is being made available.   Also,  users  without
X     ftp  capabability  should  contact  the  author to make
X     author arrangements.
X
X
X1.4. What do I need to use vvttpprriinntt?
X
X
X
X     Well, to compile and install it, you  need  an  ANSI  C
X     compiler.   (If your site has it installed already, you
X     don't need to worry about this.)

X
X
X     To use it, you need a terminal (or  terminal  emulator)
X     that supports printer control escape sequences.  If you
X     have  a  terminal  or  emulator  that  supports  escape
X     sequences  other  than  those  already in listed in the
X     vvttpprriinnttccaapp file, then you will also need to  know  what
X     those sequences are.  (Check your terminal's documenta-
X     tion.)
X
X     You also need (obviously) a printer and  some  sort  of
X     connection to the remote host.

X
X
X
X
X
X2.1. How do I install vvttpprriinntt??
X
X
X
X     If  you  are  have administrative powers on your remote
X     host, then please read the file IINNSSTTAALLLL included in the
X     original  source archive and follow the directions out-
X     lined there.
X
X
X2.2. What if I don't have root access on the remote host?
X
X
X
X     If you don't have root access on the remote  host,  you
X     can still install vvttpprriinntt.   Instead of using the "make
X     install"  and  "make  install.man"  options,  use   the
X     options  "make userinstall" and "make userinstall.man".
X     This will place the necessary files in a suitable loca-
X     tion for a user to use a private copy of vvttpprriinntt.
X
X
X2.3. How do I set up my account to use vvttpprriinntt?
X
X
X
X     If your system administrator installed a master copy of
X     vvttpprriinntt, then it should be  immediately  available  for
X     use.  However, if you installed a private copy, or your
X     system administrator did not install it  in  a  general
X     location,  you  will need to change a few environmental
X     variables.
X
X     You should verify that vvttpprriinntt is on your PATH and that
X     the  man pages are locatable somewhere on your MANPATH.

X
X
X     If you installed a personal copy, you will also need to
X     set  the  environmental variable VTPRINT to contain the
X     string "-L _<_f_u_l_l _p_a_t_h _t_o _v_t_p_r_i_n_t_c_a_p_>".  You may wish to
X     add  other  options to the VTPRINT variable to set up a
X     default operating mode for vvttpprriinntt.   Please  read  the
X     man page for details on what options are available.

X
X
X
X3.1. What help is available for using vvttpprriinntt?
X
X
X
X     Besides  the  FFAAQQ that you are reading now, there are a
X     number of resources that  can  help  you  use  vvttpprriinntt.
X     First,   there   are   the  provided  man  pages  (e.g.
X     vvttpprriinntt..11).  Also there is a brief  synopsis  available
X     by  typing "vtprint -h".  Finally, you can subscribe to
X     the vvttpprriinntt mailing list (where vvttpprriinntt topics are dis-
X     cussed,  and official announcements from the author are
X     posted) by sending mail  to  "vtprint-request@sdsu.edu"
X     with a line "subscribe" in the body of the message.
X
X     Of course, you can still contact the author directly if
X     you run into difficulties that  these  resources  can't
X     help you solve.
X
X
X3.2. How do I print text files using vvttpprriinntt?
X
X
X
X     Type  "vtprint  _<_f_i_l_e_l_i_s_t_>".   There  are  also several
X     options available.  See the man page for details on the
X     options.   Alternatively,  you  can  use vvttpprriinntt as the
X     receiving end of a pipe.
X
X
X3.3. How do I print binary files using vvttpprriinntt?
X
X
X
X     vvttpprriinntt does not  support  printing  of  binary  files.
X     This  is because vvttpprriinntt uses certain escape codes, and
X     binary files may contain escape codes which  will  con-
X     fuse vvttpprriinntt (and possibly your terminal emulator).

X
X
X3.4. What about PostScript?
X
X
X
X     Because  PostScript  is  just  ASCII  text, vvttpprriinntt can
X     print PostScript to your printer. But it DOES NOT  know
X     how   to   perform  conversion  from  regular  text  to
X     PostScript, which means  that  if  your  printer  is  a
X     PostScript only printer, you should set up some sort of
X     filter to perform ASCII to PostScript conversion before
X     piping  it to vvttpprriinntt. For example, the following shell
X     script might be used to send PostScript  to  a  printer
X     from a text file:
X
X          #!/bin/sh
X          while [ -n $1 ]; do { enscript $1 | vtprint; shift; }
X
X
X     Some   time   in  the  _f_a_r  future,  vvttpprriinntt  may  have
X     PostScript translation added to it if it  is  requested
X     by sufficiently many people.

X
X
X4.1. How do I use vvttpprriinntt with eellmm?
X
X
X
X     In  eellmm,  press "O" (for _O_p_t_i_o_n_s).  Then press "P" (for
X     _P_r_i_n_t _m_a_i_l  _u_s_i_n_g).   Now  enter  "vtprint  _[_o_p_t_i_o_n_s_]".
X     I've found that the option string "-cdq" works well for
X     me.  Finally, save your change by  pressing  ">".   Now
X     you  can  press  "I"  to return to the main mail index.
X     Pressing "P" on the mail index screen  will  print  the
X     currently selected message using vvttpprriinntt.
X
X     This  may  not  work with very old versions of eellmm.  It
X     has worked find for me since about version 2.3 or so --
X     I haven't tried it with any older versions.
X
X
X4.2. How do I use vvttpprriinntt with mmaaiill?
X
X
X
X     I  am  not sure if this works for all mailers, but with
X     the SunOS mmaaiill, if you use  the  command  "|  _[_m_e_s_s_a_g_e_-
X     _l_i_s_t_]  vtprint _[_o_p_t_i_o_n_s_]", the message will be piped to

X
X
X     vvttpprriinntt.  This strategy (using pipe) works for a  great
X     many programs besides plain old mmaaiill.
X
X
X4.3. How do I use vvttpprriinntt with ppiinnee?
X
X
X
X     You do not need to use vvttpprriinntt with ppiinnee.  The code for
X     vvttpprriinntt is derived from code the author originally  saw
X     in  ppiinnee!   To  use ppiinnee, select the "attached-to-ansi"
X     printer option, and print away!
X
X
X4.4. How do I use vvttpprriinntt with ttiinn?
X
X
X
X     You need to edit the "~/.tin/.tinrc" file.  There is  a
X     line that looks like:
X
X          default_printer=_[_s_o_m_e_t_h_i_n_g_]
X
X     You  need  merely  change  the value of _s_o_m_e_t_h_i_n_g to be
X     "vtprint" along with any options you want to use.  I've
X     found  that ttiinn is much more finnicky about the options
X     used by vvttpprriinntt, so I use the "-cdq" options.
X
X     Incidentally, vvttpprriinntt may not work with versions of ttiinn
X     prior  to 1.2pl2.  The problem was a bug in ttiinn, and is
X     fixed in more recent versions.
X
X
X4.5. How do I set up program X to use vvttpprriinntt?
X
X
X
X     I have listed above some of the more commonly used pro-
X     grams.   If your program isn't listed, and you think it
X     should be, tell me!
X
X     The general solution is to  check  out  your  program's
X     documentation  to see if the printer program it uses is
X     configurable.  If so, set it  to  "vtprint".   You  may
X     need  to  use special options -- the options "-cd" will
X     solve most problems for many people.
X
X     If the printer program can't be changed,  then  see  if
X     you can use a pipe from your program.  If so, just pipe
X     the output you wish to print to vvttpprriinntt.

X
X
X
X
X
X5.1. It  just  doesn't  work!   Nothing  is  output  by  the
X     printer,  or  the  text appears on my screen but not on
X     the printer.
X
X
X
X     This is probably a  problem  with  your  communications
X     package.   In  all likelihood, your communications pro-
X     gram may not support  required  printer  escape  codes.
X     Most  MS-DOS  and  Windows  packages  do  support these
X     codes, but the author only knows of TWO Macintosh  pro-
X     grams  and  ONE  Unix  program that support vvttpprriinntt.  A
X     simple thing to  do  is  try  "vtprint  <somefile>"  by
X     itself.  If you get output, then your terminal emulator
X     will probably work with vvttpprriinntt.
X
X     Read the file CCOOMMPPAATT for  details  about  compatibility
X     with various communications programs and terminals.
X
X     Also,  make sure that your printer is set up correctly.
X     Try printing from a local program, and make  sure  that
X     the  default is printing device is set to your printer.
X     (E.g. PRN: must be the same as the port your printer is
X     on, under MS-DOS.
X
X
X5.2. vvttpprriinntt  prints a single line, but additional lines are
X     starting at the wrong horizontal  location,  or  aren't
X     showing up at all! or Why can't I get anything past the
X     first line or two to print correctly?
X
X
X
X     You may not have CR/LF mapping set up correctly on your
X     printer,  comm  package,  host,  or  vvttpprriinntt.   You can
X     change the settings in any of these  locations  to  fix
X     it.
X
X     Check  out the "-c" and "-n" switches in the man pages.
X
X
X5.3. Why aren't page breaks included between documents?
X
X
X
X     Some terminal emulators don't  handle  formfeeds  prop-
X     erly.   TTeelleemmaattee  44..1122 is known to eat them, and MMiiccrroo--
X     pphhoonnee IIII requires a setting change to fix this problem.

X
X
X5.4. Why does vvttpprriinntt fail on big documents?
X
X
X
X     vvttpprriinntt  may  choke  on some large documents if you are
X     not using proper flow control settings.  Normally,  you
X     should use "hardware" flow control, which is also some-
X     times known as CTS/RTS flow control.   The  reason  for
X     this  is  that  the  printer may fall behind the serial
X     line, and the local  communications  program  needs  to
X     able to tell the host "wait for me to catch up with you
X     before you give me any more data -- I've  not  got  any
X     room  for it at the moment!")  You could use "XON/XOFF"
X     flow control, but this is discouraged as it may  inter-
X     fere with some other software packages which use CTRL-S
X     and CTRL-Q for other functions (such as binary transfer
X     protocols).
X
X
X5.5. Why  does  vvttpprriinntt  echo  text  (or  some  text) to the
X     screen?
X
X
X
X     Some communications programs or terminals  may  send  a
X     copy  of  the printed file to the screen as well as the
X     program.  This is legal in many cases, since many  ter-
X     minal  standards  don't  define  whether screen echoing
X     when printing should be done or not.

XThis document attempts to address some of the most common questions
Xrelating to the vtprint program.  However, this document is still very
Xmuch under development, so there may be significant
Xomissions or errors.  The author apologizes for any such errors or
Xomissions, and kindly requests that the reader pass on any corrections
Xor requests for clarification or more data to him.

X.QH 1 "About \fBvtprint\fP"
X.QH 2 "What is \fBvtprint\fP?"
X.B vtprint
Xis a program that makes it possible to obtain seamless
Xprinting from a remote host to a printer at home without
Xrequiring a TCP/IP connection to the remote machine or root access
Xon the remote machine.  It will communicate over a serial line or
Xa regular network connection.  Other methods of connection may also
Xbe possible.
X.IP
X.B vtprint
Xruns on the remote system (currently only UNIX-like systems
Xare supported).  Software on your local machine may vary
Xconsiderably.
X.QH 2 "Who writes/supports \fBvtprint\fP?"
XThe author of \fBvtprint\fP is Garrett D'Amore.  He can be reached at 
X<garrett@sciences.sdsu.edu>.  He is actively supporting \fBvtprint\fP
Xusers, and is working on new development with \fBvtprint\fP.
X.QH 2 "Where do I get \fBvtprint\fP?"
XThe original source archive for \fBvtprint\fP is available
Xvia ftp.  The current version (as of June 19, 1994) is
X2.0 and can be found at ftp.sdsu.edu in \fB/pub/vtprint/\fP as a GNU
X\fBgzip\fP compressed tar archive (\fBvtprint-2.0.tar.gz\fP).
XCurrently, only a source distribution is being made available.
XAlso, users without ftp capabability should contact the author to
Xmake author arrangements.
X.QH 2 "What do I need to use \fBvtprint\fP?"
XWell, to compile and install it, you need an ANSI C compiler.  (If
Xyour site has it installed already, you don't need to worry about
Xthis.)
X.IP
XTo use it, you need a terminal (or terminal emulator) that supports
Xprinter control escape sequences.  If you have a terminal or emulator
Xthat supports escape sequences other than those already in listed in the
X\fBvtprintcap\fP file, then you will also need to know what those sequences
Xare.  (Check your terminal's documentation.)
X.IP
XYou also need (obviously) a printer and some sort of connection to
Xthe remote host.
X.QH 1 "Installing \fBvtprint\fP"
X.QH 2 "How do I install \fBvtprint?\fP"
XIf you are have administrative powers on your remote host, then
Xplease read the file \fBINSTALL\fP included in the original source
Xarchive and follow the directions outlined there.
X.QH 2 "What if I don't have root access on the remote host?"
XIf you don't have root access on the remote host, you can still
Xinstall \fBvtprint\fP.   Instead of using the "make install" and
X"make install.man" options, use the options "make userinstall" and
X"make userinstall.man".  This will place the necessary files in a
Xsuitable location for a user to use a private copy of \fBvtprint\fP.
X.QH 2 "How do I set up my account to use \fBvtprint\fP?"
XIf your system administrator installed a master copy of \fBvtprint\fP, then
Xit should be immediately available for use.  However, if you installed
Xa private copy, or your system administrator did not install it in a general
Xlocation, you will need to change a few environmental variables.
X.IP
XYou should verify that \fBvtprint\fP is on your PATH and that the
Xman pages are locatable somewhere on your MANPATH.  If you installed a
Xpersonal copy, you will also need to set the environmental variable
XVTPRINT to contain the string "-L \fI<full path to vtprintcap>\fP".
XYou may wish to add other options to the VTPRINT variable
Xto set up a default operating mode for \fBvtprint\fP.  Please read the
Xman page for details on what options are available.
X.QH 1 "Using \fBvtprint\fP"
X.QH 2 "What help is available for using \fBvtprint\fP?"
XBesides the \fBFAQ\fP that you are reading now, there are a number
Xof resources that can help you use \fBvtprint\fP.
XFirst, there are the provided man pages (e.g. \fBvtprint.1\fP).
XAlso there is a brief synopsis available by typing "vtprint -h".  
XFinally, you can subscribe to the \fBvtprint\fP mailing list (where
X\fBvtprint\fP topics
Xare discussed, and official announcements from the author are posted)
Xby sending mail to "vtprint-request@sdsu.edu" with a line "subscribe"
Xin the body of the message. 
X.IP
XOf course, you can still contact the author directly if you run into
Xdifficulties that these resources can't help you solve.
X.QH 2 "How do I print text files using \fBvtprint\fP?"
XType "vtprint \fI<filelist>\fP".  There are also several options
Xavailable.  See the man page for details on the options.
XAlternatively, you can use \fBvtprint\fP as the receiving end of a
Xpipe.
X.QH 2 "How do I print binary files using \fBvtprint\fP?"
X\fBvtprint\fP does not support printing of binary files.
XThis is because \fBvtprint\fP
Xuses certain escape codes, and binary files may contain escape
Xcodes which will confuse \fBvtprint\fP (and possibly your terminal emulator).
X.QH 2 "What about PostScript?"
XBecause PostScript is just ASCII text, \fBvtprint\fP can print PostScript
Xto your printer. But it DOES NOT know how to perform conversion
Xfrom regular text to PostScript, which means that if your printer 
Xis a PostScript only printer, you should set up some sort of filter
Xto perform ASCII to PostScript conversion before piping it to
X\fBvtprint\fP. For example, the following shell script might be used to
Xsend PostScript to a printer from a text file:
X.ID
X#!/bin/sh
X.br
Xwhile [ -n $1 ]; do { enscript $1 | vtprint; shift; }
X.DE
X.IP
XSome time in the \fIfar\fP future, \fBvtprint\fP may have PostScript
Xtranslation added to it if it is requested by sufficiently many people.
X.QH 1 "Using \fBvtprint\fP with other UNIX-based programs."
X.QH 2 "How do I use \fBvtprint\fP with \fBelm\fP?"
XIn \fBelm\fP, press "O"
X(for \fIOptions\fP).  Then press "P" (for
X\fIPrint mail using\fP).  Now enter "vtprint \fI[options]\fP".  I've
Xfound that the option string "-cdq" works well for me.  Finally, save
Xyour change by pressing ">".  Now you can press "I" to return to the
Xmain mail index.  Pressing "P" on the mail index screen will print the
Xcurrently selected message using \fBvtprint\fP.
X.IP
XThis may not work with very old versions of \fBelm\fP.  It has worked
Xfind for me since about version 2.3 or so -- I haven't tried it with
Xany older versions.
X.QH 2 "How do I use \fBvtprint\fP with \fBmail\fP?"
XI am not sure if this works for all mailers, but with the SunOS \fBmail\fP,
Xif you use the command "| \fI[message-list]\fP vtprint \fI[options]\fP", the
Xmessage will be piped to \fBvtprint\fP.  This strategy (using pipe) works
Xfor a great many programs besides plain old \fBmail\fP.
X.QH 2 "How do I use \fBvtprint\fP with \fBpine\fP?"
XYou do not need to use \fBvtprint\fP with \fBpine\fP.  The code for
X\fBvtprint\fP is derived from code the author originally saw in
X\fBpine\fP!  To use \fBpine\fP, select the "attached-to-ansi" printer
Xoption, and print away!
X.QH 2 "How do I use \fBvtprint\fP with \fBtin\fP?"
XYou need to edit the "~/.tin/.tinrc" file.  There is a line that looks
Xlike:
X.ID
Xdefault_printer=\fI[something]\fP
X.DE
XYou need merely change the value of \fIsomething\fP to be "vtprint" along
Xwith any options you want to use.  I've found that \fBtin\fP is much
Xmore finnicky about the options used by \fBvtprint\fP, so I use
Xthe "-cdq" options.
X.IP
XIncidentally, \fBvtprint\fP may not work with versions of \fBtin\fP prior
Xto 1.2pl2.  The problem was a bug in \fBtin\fP, and is fixed in more
Xrecent versions.
X.QH 2 "How do I set up program X to use \fBvtprint\fP?"
XI have listed above some of the more commonly used programs.  If your
Xprogram isn't listed, and you think it should be, tell me!
X.IP
XThe general solution is to check out your program's documentation to
Xsee if the printer program it uses is configurable.  If so, set it to
X"vtprint".  You may need to use special options \-\- the options 
X"-cd" will solve most problems for many people.
X.IP
XIf the printer program can't be changed, then see if you can use a 
Xpipe from your program.  If so, just pipe the output you wish to print
Xto \fBvtprint\fP.
X.QH 1 Problems
X.QH 2 "It just doesn't work!  Nothing is output by the printer, or the \
Xtext appears on my screen but not on the printer."
XThis is probably a problem with your communications package.  In
Xall likelihood, your communications program may not support required
Xprinter escape codes.  Most MS-DOS and Windows packages do support
Xthese codes, but the author only knows of TWO Macintosh programs and
XONE Unix program that support \fBvtprint\fP.  A simple thing to do is
Xtry "vtprint <somefile>" by itself.  If you get output, then
Xyour terminal emulator will probably work with \fBvtprint\fP.
X.IP
XRead the file \fBCOMPAT\fP for details about compatibility with various
Xcommunications programs and terminals.
X.IP
XAlso, make sure that your printer is set up correctly.  Try
Xprinting from a local program, and make sure that the default is
Xprinting device is set to your printer.  (E.g. PRN: must be the
Xsame as the port your printer is on, under MS-DOS.
X.QH 2 "\fBvtprint\fP prints a single line, but additional lines are starting \
Xat the wrong horizontal location, or aren't showing up at all! or Why \
Xcan't I get anything past the first line or two to print correctly?"
XYou may not have CR/LF mapping set up correctly on your printer,
Xcomm package, host, or \fBvtprint\fP.  You can change the settings in any
Xof these locations to fix it.  
X.IP
XCheck out the "-c" and "-n" switches in the man pages.
X.QH 2 "Why aren't page breaks included between documents?"
XSome terminal emulators don't handle formfeeds properly.  \fBTelemate 4.12\fP
Xis known to eat them, and \fBMicrophone II\fP requires a setting
Xchange to fix this problem.
X.QH 2 "Why does \fBvtprint\fP fail on big documents?"
X\fBvtprint\fP may choke on some large documents if you are not using proper
Xflow control settings.  Normally, you should use "hardware" flow control,
Xwhich is also sometimes known as CTS/RTS flow control.  The reason for
Xthis is that the printer may fall behind the serial line, and the local
Xcommunications program needs to able to tell the host "wait for me to
Xcatch up with you before you give me any more data -- I've not got any
Xroom for it at the moment!")  You could use "XON/XOFF" flow control,
Xbut this is discouraged as it may interfere with some other software
Xpackages which use CTRL-S and CTRL-Q for other functions (such as binary
Xtransfer protocols).
X.QH 2 "Why does \fBvtprint\fP echo text (or some text) to the screen?"
XSome communications programs or terminals may send a copy of the printed
Xfile to the screen as well as the program.  This is legal in many cases,
Xsince many terminal standards don't define whether screen echoing 
Xwhen printing should be done or not.

X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.B vtprint
Xis a simple filter that prints ASCII text to a printer connected to a 
Xterminal or terminal emulator.  It uses terminal escape sequences to
Xprint, and can substitute for 
X.B "lpr\fR(1)"
Xin circumstances where the printer is not connected directly to the host or
Xavailable via TCP/IP.
X.SH OPTIONS
X.TP
X.B \-b
XCauses \fBvtprint\fP to open the output stream in binary modes, overriding
Xany automatic postprocessing done by the host (e.g. CR/LF translations).
XThis has no effect if the output stream is not a tty device.
X.TP
X.B \-B
XUndoes the effect of the \fB\-b\fP option.  Note that this does \fInot\fP
Xopen the output stream in text mode if it would not normally be opened in
Xthat mode.
X.TP
X.B \-c
XCauses \fBvtprint\fP
Xto append any linefeeds (ASCII 0xA) with carriage returns
X(ASCII 0xD).  This is useful for printing data from a UNIX or similiar
Xhost to an MS-DOS system's printer that expects CR/LF line termination.
X.TP
X.B \-C
XCauses \fBvtprint\fP
Xto pass all carriage returns and linefeeds unmodified.
X.TP
X.B \-d
XUse the tty device file instead of stdout for output.  This is defined as
X.B /dev/tty
Xon this system. (This is operating system specific and may vary from system to
Xsystem.) This is useful for using \fBvtprint\fP
Xas a pipe called by programs that suppress or redirect the stdout stream
Xof the pipe or printing process.
X.TP
X.B \-D
XUse the stdout stream for output, rather than a tty device file.
X.TP
X.B \-e
XForces \fBvtprint\fP to ignore the TERM environment variable and use
Xthe builtin control codes instead.
X.TP
X.B \-E
XUndoes the effect of the \fB\-e\fP option, which allows \fBvtprint\fP to
Xattempt to find an entry in \fB/usr/local/lib/vtprint/vtprintcap\fP for the TERM value and use the
Xcorresponding control codes.
X.TP
X.B \-f
XRequests \fBvtprint\fP to suppress inclusion of formfeeds (ASCII 0xC) between 
Xmultiple files.  Note that this has no affect on any formfeeds that may
Xbe present in the input files already.
X.TP
X.B \-F
XRequests \fBvtprint\fP to include formfeeds between multiple files specified
Xon the command-line and at the end of the last file printed.
X.TP
X.B \-h
XPrint out a simple usage message.
X.TP
X.B \-l
XPrint out the \fBvtprint\fP license agreement.
X.TP
X.BI \-L " vtprintcap"
XSpecifies an alternate file to use instead of \fB/usr/local/lib/vtprint/vtprintcap\fP.
X.TP
X.B \-n
XCauses \fBvtprint\fP to strip the CR from any CR/LF sequences.  This will
Xnot affect handling of any CRs present elsewhere in the file.
X.TP
X.B \-N
XCauses \fBvtprint\fP
Xto pass all carriage returns and linefeeds unmodified.
X.TP
X.B \-q
XQuiet mode.  Suppress various status messages from being displayed, useful
Xin situations where \fBvtprint\fP
Xis used as part of a shell script, for example.
X.TP
X.B \-Q
XCancels the effect of the \fB\-q\fP option, allowing normal progress 
Xreporting to occur.
X.TP
X.B \-t
XForce the use of the TERM variable to perform a look up of the control
Xsequences to be used in \fB/usr/local/lib/vtprint/vtprintcap\fP.  If an entry in that file can't
Xbe found, \fBvtprint\fP will abort with an error.
X.TP
X.BI \-T " termtype"
XUse the value of \fItermtype\fP instead of the value of the TERM environment
Xvariable when performing lookups in \fB/usr/local/lib/vtprint/vtprintcap\fP.
X.TP
X.B \-v
XDisplay version information.
X.TP
X.BI \-V " device"
XSpecifies an alternate device file instead of \fB/dev/tty\fP to use.
X.TP
X.B \-w
XDisplay important warranty waiver information.  NO WARRANTY!
X.TP
X.B \-\-
XThis option changes no special operational parameters of
X.B vtprint.
XBut it does indicate to the program that all of the command-line arguments
Xwhich follow are to be parsed as filenames, even if they begin with a dash.
XHence to process a single file with the name "file" you would call 
X.B vtprint
Xas "
X\fBvtprint\fP  \-\-  \-file".
X.SH ENVIRONMENT
X.IP TERM
Xthe type of the terminal 
X.B vtprint
Xwill assume is being used.
X.IP VTPRINT
Xstring of options to be used by
X.B vtprint.
X.SH AUTHOR
X.B vtprint
Xwas written by Garrett D'Amore, on December 27, 1993 and last modified on
XJune 19, 1994.  It is heavily derived
Xfrom a similar program, called
X.B lprint,
Xby the same author.
XHe can be reached via Internet e-mail at garrett@sciences.sdsu.edu.
X.SH DISTRIBUTION
XThe latest version of
X.B vtprint
Xcan be obtained by anonymous ftp at ftp.sdsu.edu in the
X.B /pub/vtprint
Xdirectory.  Please read the
X.B INDEX
Xand
X.B README
Xfiles before downloading.
X.LP
XIf you do not have ftp availability, then you can request a
Xuuencoded copy of 
X.B vtprint
Xbe sent to you via e-mail from the author.  The author is also willing to
Xmake other arrangements as needed, within certain limitations.
X.SH MAILING LIST
XA mailing list for the discussion of topics related to and about
X\fBvtprint\fP exists.  To subscribe to this mailing list, send a
Xmessage to "vtprint-request@sdsu.edu" with the word "subscribe" as
Xthe body.  An automated list server will reply with information about
Xthe mailing list.
X.SH COPYRIGHT
X.B vtprint
Xis copyrighted 1994, by Garrett D'Amore.  It may be freely redistributed
Xor modified, so long as this and any other copyright notices are included
Xin their original form with the program.  The user is granted the right to 
Xuse this program without limitation.
X.SH DISCLAIMER
X.B vtprint
Xis provided WITHOUT WARRANTY.  The user agrees to indemnify
Xthe author from any claims of damage or loss arising from the use
Xof or inability to use this program.  In other words, USE AT YOUR
XOWN RISK! 
X.SH CAVEATS
X.B vtprint
Xcannot be used to print files containing non-printable characters, as
Xthese may cause conflicts with the terminal or emulator used.
X.PP
XWhen used over a serial (modem) connection, \fBvtprint\fP may not work
Xproperly unless hardware (CTS/RTS) flow control is used.  This is due to
Xthe fact that most printers are slower than serial connections in common
Xuse.  
X.PP	
X.B vtprint
Xuses terminal escape sequences to print, and not all
Xterminal emulators
Xsupport these sequences, and of those that do, some support it differently.
XYou can find a listing of some of the programs known to work and not to
Xwork with
X.B vtprint
Xin the file
X.B COMPAT.
XThe best thing to do is try your particular emulator, and find out if
Xit works.  The author would appreciate any reports of
Xsuccess or failure, or strange behavior.  You can send those to him via
XInternet e-mail.  (See the
X.B AUTHOR
Xchapter for how to reach him.)
X.LP
XThe \fB/usr/local/lib/vtprint/vtprintcap\fP file is still largely incomplete.  The author would very
Xmuch appreciate it if individuals with more information different terminals
Xwould get in contact with him so that support can be added for these terminals
Xin the master archive.
X.LP
XDo \fInot\fP
Xbackground this program, as it has no way of knowing when it is in the
Xbackground and when it is in the foreground.  This will result in your 
Xforeground process' output being printed as well as the output from
X.B vtprint.
X.SH FILES
X.B /usr/local/lib/vtprint/vtprintcap
X.SH TODOS
XFix any bugs present, clean-up the documentation, continue to build
Xupon entries in the \fBCOMPAT\fP and \fB/usr/local/lib/vtprint/vtprintcap\fP files, and  finally, 
Xfinish getting a college education!
X.SH BUGS
X.B vtprint 
Xdoesn't handle some signals properly, especially the SIGKILL and SIGSTOP
Xsignals, which can't be caught anyway.  Also it doesn't check to see if
Xyou have backgrounded the process.  The resulting condition may leave all
Xoutput directed to the printer instead of the screen.  The fix for this
Xcondition is to run the provided
X.B vtprtoff
Xprogram with no arguments, which will restore normal screen output.  (You
Xprobably won't be able to see what you're typing while you start 
X.B vtprtoff
Xfrom the shell.)

X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.B vtprint
Xis a simple filter that prints ASCII text to a printer connected to a 
Xterminal or terminal emulator.  It uses terminal escape sequences to
Xprint, and can substitute for 
X.B "LPR_BIN\fR(LPR_SECT)"
Xin circumstances where the printer is not connected directly to the host or
Xavailable via TCP/IP.
X.SH OPTIONS
X.TP
X.B \-b
XCauses \fBvtprint\fP to open the output stream in binary modes, overriding
Xany automatic postprocessing done by the host (e.g. CR/LF translations).
XThis has no effect if the output stream is not a tty device.
X.TP
X.B \-B
XUndoes the effect of the \fB\-b\fP option.  Note that this does \fInot\fP
Xopen the output stream in text mode if it would not normally be opened in
Xthat mode.
X.TP
X.B \-c
XCauses \fBvtprint\fP
Xto append any linefeeds (ASCII 0xA) with carriage returns
X(ASCII 0xD).  This is useful for printing data from a UNIX or similiar
Xhost to an MS-DOS system's printer that expects CR/LF line termination.
X.TP
X.B \-C
XCauses \fBvtprint\fP
Xto pass all carriage returns and linefeeds unmodified.
X.TP
X.B \-d
XUse the tty device file instead of stdout for output.  This is defined as
X.B DEVTTY
Xon this system. (This is operating system specific and may vary from system to
Xsystem.) This is useful for using \fBvtprint\fP
Xas a pipe called by programs that suppress or redirect the stdout stream
Xof the pipe or printing process.
X.TP
X.B \-D
XUse the stdout stream for output, rather than a tty device file.
X.TP
X.B \-e
XForces \fBvtprint\fP to ignore the TERM environment variable and use
Xthe builtin control codes instead.
X.TP
X.B \-E
XUndoes the effect of the \fB\-e\fP option, which allows \fBvtprint\fP to
Xattempt to find an entry in \fBLIBFILE\fP for the TERM value and use the
Xcorresponding control codes.
X.TP
X.B \-f
XRequests \fBvtprint\fP to suppress inclusion of formfeeds (ASCII 0xC) between 
Xmultiple files.  Note that this has no affect on any formfeeds that may
Xbe present in the input files already.
X.TP
X.B \-F
XRequests \fBvtprint\fP to include formfeeds between multiple files specified
Xon the command-line and at the end of the last file printed.
X.TP
X.B \-h
XPrint out a simple usage message.
X.TP
X.B \-l
XPrint out the \fBvtprint\fP license agreement.
X.TP
X.BI \-L " vtprintcap"
XSpecifies an alternate file to use instead of \fBLIBFILE\fP.
X.TP
X.B \-n
XCauses \fBvtprint\fP to strip the CR from any CR/LF sequences.  This will
Xnot affect handling of any CRs present elsewhere in the file.
X.TP
X.B \-N
XCauses \fBvtprint\fP
Xto pass all carriage returns and linefeeds unmodified.
X.TP
X.B \-q
XQuiet mode.  Suppress various status messages from being displayed, useful
Xin situations where \fBvtprint\fP
Xis used as part of a shell script, for example.
X.TP
X.B \-Q
XCancels the effect of the \fB\-q\fP option, allowing normal progress 
Xreporting to occur.
X.TP
X.B \-t
XForce the use of the TERM variable to perform a look up of the control
Xsequences to be used in \fBLIBFILE\fP.  If an entry in that file can't
Xbe found, \fBvtprint\fP will abort with an error.
X.TP
X.BI \-T " termtype"
XUse the value of \fItermtype\fP instead of the value of the TERM environment
Xvariable when performing lookups in \fBLIBFILE\fP.
X.TP
X.B \-v
XDisplay version information.
X.TP
X.BI \-V " device"
XSpecifies an alternate device file instead of \fBDEVTTY\fP to use.
X.TP
X.B \-w
XDisplay important warranty waiver information.  NO WARRANTY!
X.TP
X.B \-\-
XThis option changes no special operational parameters of
X.B vtprint.
XBut it does indicate to the program that all of the command-line arguments
Xwhich follow are to be parsed as filenames, even if they begin with a dash.
XHence to process a single file with the name "file" you would call 
X.B vtprint
Xas "
X\fBvtprint\fP  \-\-  \-file".
X.SH ENVIRONMENT
X.IP TERM
Xthe type of the terminal 
X.B vtprint
Xwill assume is being used.
X.IP VTPRINT
Xstring of options to be used by
X.B vtprint.

X.SH CAVEATS
X.B vtprint
Xcannot be used to print files containing non-printable characters, as
Xthese may cause conflicts with the terminal or emulator used.
X.PP
XWhen used over a serial (modem) connection, \fBvtprint\fP may not work
Xproperly unless hardware (CTS/RTS) flow control is used.  This is due to
Xthe fact that most printers are slower than serial connections in common
Xuse.  
X.PP	
X.B vtprint
Xuses terminal escape sequences to print, and not all
Xterminal emulators
Xsupport these sequences, and of those that do, some support it differently.
XYou can find a listing of some of the programs known to work and not to
Xwork with
X.B vtprint
Xin the file
X.B COMPAT.
XThe best thing to do is try your particular emulator, and find out if
Xit works.  The author would appreciate any reports of
Xsuccess or failure, or strange behavior.  You can send those to him via
XInternet e-mail.  (See the
X.B AUTHOR

X.LP
XThe \fBLIBFILE\fP file is still largely incomplete.  The author would very
Xmuch appreciate it if individuals with more information different terminals
Xwould get in contact with him so that support can be added for these terminals
Xin the master archive.
X.LP
XDo \fInot\fP
Xbackground this program, as it has no way of knowing when it is in the
Xbackground and when it is in the foreground.  This will result in your 
Xforeground process' output being printed as well as the output from
X.B vtprint.
X.SH FILES
X.B LIBFILE
X.SH TODOS
XFix any bugs present, clean-up the documentation, continue to build
Xupon entries in the \fBCOMPAT\fP and \fBLIBFILE\fP files, and  finally, 
Xfinish getting a college education!
X.SH BUGS
X.B vtprint 
Xdoesn't handle some signals properly, especially the SIGKILL and SIGSTOP
Xsignals, which can't be caught anyway.  Also it doesn't check to see if
Xyou have backgrounded the process.  The resulting condition may leave all
Xoutput directed to the printer instead of the screen.  The fix for this
Xcondition is to run the provided
X.B vtprtoff
Xprogram with no arguments, which will restore normal screen output.  (You
Xprobably won't be able to see what you're typing while you start 
X.B vtprtoff
Xfrom the shell.)

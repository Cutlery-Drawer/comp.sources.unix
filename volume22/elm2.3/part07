X.lp "\h'4p'\f2Berkeley Mail\f1" 1.0i
XA surprisingly sophisticated mailer, especially the version with 4.3 BSD,
X\f2Berkeley Mail\f1 still suffers from the tendency to force the user to
Xknow too much about the system, and also lacks a friendly, non-cryptic
Xinterface for the large subset of the population that use Unix but aren't
Xinterested in becoming a ``hacker''.
X
X.lp \h'4p'\f2MH\f1 1.0i
XThis is another nifty mailer.  The main difference between this and the
Xother mailers about is that it is a discrete set of programs rather than
Xa single unified interface.  This is quite useful for those people that
Xreceive \f2lots\f1 of mail and are willing to spend some time learning
Xthe intricacies of the program.  It's quite powerful, but again, misses some
Xof the basic friendly features the majority of users are interested in.
X
X.lp \h'4p'\f2dmail\f1 1.0i
XA sort of mutated cross between \f2MH\f1 and \f2Berkeley Mail\f1, it was
Xthis program that convinced me to implement the \f2Limit\f1 functions.
X
X.lp \h'4p'\f2NMail\f1 1.0i
X(a part of the HP AI Workstation Software Environment).  This program hints
Xat the power that mailers could be given to help deal with mail in a quick
Xand intelligent fashion.  Most of what it can do, and a lot more, are 
Xtherefore part of \f3Elm\f1.  Indubitably.  And quite faster too!
X
X.lp \h'4p'\f2PMX/TERM\f1 1.0i
XPart of the AT&T Mail package, a single glance at this interface convinced
Xme that a PC interface, with almost half of the screen taken up by a silly
Xfunction key mapping, is most certainly \f2not\f1 the way to do things!!
XOn the other hand, it also shows that the \f2Forms\f1 mode can be quite
Xnicely integrated into a more sophisticated mailer.
X
X.lp \h'4p'\f2fmail\f1 1.0i
XA nickel addition to the \f2/bin/mail\f1 program to add some rudimentary
Xscreen interface stuff, this nonetheless interesting mailer is part of 
Xthe AT&T Toolchest.
X
X.lp \h'4p'\f2Laurel\f1 1.0i
XA program only available within Xerox PARC, this was an interesting
Xearly attempt at a graphics based full-screen mail program.  The one,
Xperhaps trivial, part of the interface I really like was the fact that
Xit would \f2cross out\f1 a message that was marked for deletion.  One
Xday when we get real graphics and the ability to use them indicated in
Xa facility (not too) like \f2termcap\f1, perhaps \f3Elm\f1 will do 
Xthis too! 
X
X.lp \h'4p'\f2Mailtool\f1 1.0i
XPart of the Sun distribution package, this program is a really nice
Xexample of what can be done by putting a smart shell on top of a dumb
Xprogram \(em it uses \f2/bin/mail\f1 for all the `dirty work'.  Other than
Xthat, it's not a particularly interesting interface or mailer, and it
Xcertainly doesn't add much functionality!
X
X.lp \h'4p'\f2Metamail\f1 1.0i
XWhat can I say?  This isn't even a real mailer, but is just what I dream
Xof as an interface to mail in the future.  A program that works sort of
Xlike \f3HAL\f1 did in \f22001: A Space Odyssey\f1 \(em where it interrupts
Xme as appropriate for important mail, and can answer inane and other
Xqueries itself according to what I teach it.  Maybe \f3Elm\f1, by some sort
Xof groupmind metamorphosis, will change into that someday.  Maybe not.  Maybe
Xno-one bothers to read this far into the document!!
X
X.in 0
XFinally, it's also been a very useful experience overall,
Xconfirming my beliefs that iterative software design and
Xkeeping a close watch on users (not to mention an open
Xmind and mailbox!) improves a product manyfold.  Comments,
Xfeedback and bug reports (and fixes!) are, of course, always welcome!

X
XAs coordinator of the Elm Development Group, I must add to the credits.
XThis group of volunteers has taken the Elm code from Dave Taylor and
Xadded features, made it more robust, and more portable.
X.sp
XFor getting the Usenet Elm group going, for without which I wouldn't be
Xwriting this, thanks to Greg Hackney at Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.
X.sp
XFor the Configuration system and its newer Dist 2.0 version, thanks are
Xdue to Larry Wall of JPL-NASA.
X.sp
XFor his over two hundred sets of changes to version 2.2, Elm owes a lot
Xto Rob Bernardo at Pacbell.
X.sp
XThe ability to run Elm at all on Intel 286 machines owes a lot to the
Xinsistent nudging of the coordinator by Chip Salzenberg,
XChip Rosenthal, and Tim Evans.
X.sp
XFor getting us the rights to use the news macros and converting all
Xthe documentation over to those macros, thanks to Mike Brown.

X.TH ANSWER 1L "Elm Version 2.3" "USENET Community Trust"
X.SH NAME
Xanswer - phone message transcription system
X.SH SYNOPSIS
X.B answer
X.PP
X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.I Answer\^
Xis a part of the 
X.B Elm
Xmail system and is designed for secretaries and the like
Xto allow them to answer phones and|or listen to phone message
Xmachines and quickly and easily transcribe the messages into
Xelectronic mail.
X.P
XThe program uses its own alias set (usually a subset of the
Xsystem aliases, with more fields per user (ie unique first
Xnames, unique last names, first-initial lastname, and so on)).
XNote this means that you must create and then install, using
X.I newalias,
Xa separate alias table for the account this program is to 
Xbe run from.
X.P
XInterface-wise, the program is a breeze to use - type 'answer'
Xto start it up and then merely type a user name at the
X.nf
X	
X	Message to:
X
X.fi
Xprompt, and then enter the message, ending with a blank line.
XNames can be entered as 'Firstname Lastname' and the system
Xwill try to find a mail alias based on the first letter of the
Xfirst name plus the last name.  For example, 'Dave Taylor'
Xwill cause the program to search for an alias 'd_taylor' in
Xthe file (note the transliteration into lower case).   The 
Xprogram will loop until killed or quit.
X.P
X.I Answer
Xcan be easily exited by typing any of 'quit', 'exit' 'done', 
Xor 'bye' at the 'Message to:' prompt.

X.SH SYNOPSIS
X.B autoreply
X.br
X.B "autoreply off"
X.br
X.B autoreply
X.I filename
X.PP
X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.I Autoreply\^
Xis a part of \fBThe Elm Mail System\fR
Xand is designed to enable users to easily set up
Xan automatic response to all mail they receive.  This is
Xtypically during a vacation or some other period of time that
Xthe user is not available to reply to mail (although some
Xpeople get enough mail that they have it permanently running
Xto simply send an "ack" to each message)
X.PP
XThe system is quite easy to use...
XYou can type "autoreply" and be informed of your current
Xstatus in the system (on or off), or "autoreply off" will
Xturn your autoreplying off.
X.PP
XTo add yourself to the system, you need merely to compose a
Xform response in a file somewhere, then type "autoreply \fIfile\fR"
Xwhere \fIfile\fR is the name of the file.
X.SH "SPECIAL NOTE"
XFor this to function correctly, the program "arepdaemon" must
Xbe running as a daemon in background.  This program automatically
Xchecks all the currently enrolled users for new mail in their
Xmailboxes...

X.SH "BUGS"
XUnfortunately, this program isn't too brilliant about identifying
Xmail that shouldn't be responded to (like mail from other
Xdaemons, or your mother) but that's a more general problem anyway.
X.sp
XAlso, occasionally a user will remove themselves from the
Xautoreply system and the system won't turn their autoreply
Xoff.  This is a problem that hasn't been solved yet (obviously
Xsince it's in the "bugs" section!!) and any further information
Xwould be appreciated!

X.TH CHECKALIAS 1L "Elm Version 2.3" "USENET Community Trust"
X.SH NAME
Xcheckalias - check to see if an alias is defined.
X.SH SYNOPSIS
X.B checkalias
Xalias, alias, ...
X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.I Checkalias
Xchecks the user file first, and then the system alias file
Xto try to find the specified alias or aliases.  If found, 
Xthe value of the alias is printed out, otherwise an error
Xis generated.

X.SH BUGS
XNote that the precedence of aliases is user file then system
Xfile.  This means that a user can 'overload' an alias by having
Xone defined in the system file also defined in theirs.  This
Xshouldn't turn out to be a problem, but is something for
Xthe system administrator to keep in mind when creating the
Xsystem alias file.

X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.I Elm\^
Xis an interactive screen-oriented mailer program that supercedes 
X.I mail
Xand 
X.I mailx.
X.PP
XThere are three main ways to use the \fBelm\fR mailer.  One way
Xto use the mailer is to specify a list of addresses on the
Xcommand line when the mailer is invoked.  This will allow sending
Xof a single message to the specified recipients with all the
Xoptions usually available in the \fBelm\fR system itself. For example,
Xthe command
X.nf
X
X	elm -s testing joe
X
X.fi
Xwould initiate the sending of a message to the alias joe with the subject
X"testing" indicated and
Xwould put you into an editor for you to enter the text of the message.
XIf the subject flag and argument were not present, you would be prompted
Xfor a message subject.
X.PP
XThe second way, used most commonly when transmitting files and such,
Xis to specify the subject of the message and the recipients using
Xthe command line and redirect a file as standard input.  For example,
Xthe command 
X.nf
X
X	elm -s testing joe < test.c 
X
X.fi
Xwould mail a copy of the
Xfile test.c to alias joe, with the subject "testing" indicated.
XThe subject flag and argument are optional.
X.PP
XThe third way, elm is invoked
Xwith neither subject nor addresses specified on the command line and
Xwithout standard input redirected.
XYou can then read any messages in your incoming mailbox (or specified
Xfolder), reply to messages in the mailbox, mail messages, etc.
X.PP
XOptions are:
X.TP 1.0i
X.B "  -a"
XArrow - force the arrow cursor (instead of the inverse bar)
X.TP
X.B "  -c"
XCheckalias - expand the following aliases and return.
X.TP
X.B "  -d \fIlevel\fR  "
XDebug - set specified debug level - Output to "$HOME/ELM:debug.info"
X.TP
X.B "  -f \fIalternative-folder\fR  "
XFolder - read folder (specified) rather than the incoming mailbox.
X.TP
X.B "  -h"
XHelp - give a list of starting options.
X.TP
X.B "  -?"
XSynonymous with the "-h" option.
X.TP
X.B "  -k"
XKeypad - force knowledge of HP terminal keyboard, to allow
Xthe use of the NEXT, PREV and HOME/SHIFT-HOME keys.
X.TP
X.B "  -K"
XKeypad + softkeys - enable use of softkeys on HP terminals only.
X.TP
X.B "  -m"
XMenu off - Use the extra lines for more message headers.
X.TP
X.B "  -s \fIsubj\fR  "
XSubject - specify subject for message to mail.
X.TP
X.B "  -v"
XVersion - print version and configuration information.
X.TP
X.B "  -z"
XZero - don't enter \fBElm\fR if no mail is pending.

X.TH FASTMAIL 1L "Elm Version 2.3" "USENET Community Trust"
X.SH NAME
Xfastmail - quick batch mail interface to a single address
X.SH SYNOPSIS
X.B fastmail
X[-b bcc-list] [-c cc-list] [-d] [-f fromname] [-r replyto] 
X[-s subject] filename address-list
X.br
X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.I Fastmail
Xis a low-level interface to the mail system that allows batch
Xprocessing of mail.  It's intended for mailing to very large
Xgroups of people in a staggered fashion. 
X.PP
XThe starting options are;
X.TP 1.0i
X.B "-b bcc-list"
XThis allows a list of people to receive blind-carbon copies, or BCCs, of
Xthe message.  This list should be full email addresses.
X.TP
X.B "-c cc-list"
XThis allows a list of people to receive carbon copies, or CCs, of
Xthe message.  This list should be full email addresses.
X.TP
X.B "-d"
XDebug.  This is helpful for strange, unfriendly errors from
Xthe program (etc).
X.TP
X.B "-f from"
XThis overrides the users name in the From: line, so that if
Xthe user was x@y, and their name was MrX then the default 
XFrom: line would be "From: x@y (MrX)".  Using "-f Joe" when
Xinvoking this, though, would change it to "From: x@y (Joe)"
X.TP
X.B "-r replyto"
XOccasionally, you might send mail but want the replies to go
Xto a different address (very common with mailing lists).  
XThere is a header for this purpose called "Reply-To:" which
Xcan be utilized by using this starting option.  For example,
Xwe could send mail with a reply-to to list-request by
Xusing "-r list-request".  The header generated would then
Xbe of the form "Reply-To: list-request".
X.TP
X.B "-s subject"
XThe subject of the message is specified by using 
Xthis starting option.
X.SH EXAMPLE
XLet's say we're user "big" on machine "big-vax" and we have a
Xshell script called 'batch-mail' that contains the following
Xlines:
X.nf
X
X   #
X   # Batch Mail - batch mailing of a file to a LOT of users
X   #  
X   # Usage: batch-mail "from" "subject" filename
X
X   sender_copy = $LOGIN
X   replto = "The-Mr-Big-list"
X
X   fastmail -b $sender_copy -r $replyto -f "$1" -s "$2" $3 person1
X   sleep 10
X   fastmail -r $replyto -f "$1" -s "$2" $3 person2
X   sleep 10
X   fastmail -r $replyto -f "$1" -s "$2" $3 person3
X   sleep 10
X   fastmail -r $replyto -f "$1" -s "$2" $3 person4
X
X   < etc >
X
Xwith the invocation:
X
X   batch-mail "Mr. Big" "Warning to all" warning.text
X
X.fi
Xwould mail a copy of the 'warning.text' file to person1, person2, 
Xperson3, etc.  "$LOGIN" will also receive a copy of the first message
Xin the mail, \fIsilently\fR.  Each resultant message will include the headers:
X.nf
X
X    From: big-vax!big (Mr. Big)
X    Subject: Warning to all
X    Reply-To: The-Mr-Big-list
X
X.fi
XThis program should turn out to be considerably
Xfaster than the alternative methods of accomplishing this task.

X.SH SYNOPSIS
X.B newalias
X[-g]
X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.I Newalias
Xcreates new hash and data files from a text file.
XIf the program is invoked with the
X.I -g
X(global) flag, the program updates the system alias files.
XOtherwise, the program looks for a file called \fI$HOME/.elm/aliases.text\fR
Xand, upon finding it, creates files \fI$HOME/.elm/aliases.hash\fR and
X\fI$HOME/.elm/aliases.data\fR for the
X.I elm
Xprogram.
X.PP
XThe format that the program expects is;
X.sp
X.nf
X	alias, alias, .. = comment = address
Xor
X	alias, alias, .. = comment = alias, alias, ...
X   
XThe first form is for an individual user such as;
X
X	dave, taylor = Dave Taylor = veeger!hpcnou!dat
X
Xand the second is for defining a group alias such as;
X
X	gurus = Unix Gurus = alan, john, dave, mike, richard,
X		             larry, t_richardson
X
X.fi
X.sp
XNote that lines can be continued at will, blank lines are accepted
Xwithout error, and that any line starting with '#' is considered a
Xcomment and is not processed.
X.sp
XAliases are case insensitive so dave and Dave are both the same alias.
X.PP
XFinally, aliases can contain other aliases, and/or groups;
X.sp
X.nf
X	unix = Unix people = gurus, taylor, jonboy
X.fi

X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.I Newmail\^
Xis a program to allow monitoring of mailboxes in an intelligent
Xfashion.  It is based loosely on \fIbiff(1)\fR and the version
Xof \fInewmail\fR that was distributed with \fBElm 1.7\fR.
X.P
XThe basic operation is that the program will check the list of
Xspecified mailboxes each \fIinterval\fR seconds and will list
Xany new mail that has arrived in any of the mailboxes,
Xindicating the sender name, and the subject of the message.
X.P
XEach entry displayed can be in a number of different formats
Xdepending on the mode of the program, the number of folders
Xbeing monitored, and the status of the message.  If you're 
Xrunning it as a \fIwindow\fR (e.g. ``-w''
Xor invoked as \fIwnewmail\fR) then the output will be
Xsimilar to:
X.nf
X
X   \fIsender name\fR - \fIsubject of message\fR
X   Priority: \fIsender name\fR - \fIsubject of message\fR
X
X.fi
Xwhere <sender name> is either the name of the person sending it,
Xif available (the ARPA 'From:' line) or some other brief
Xindication of origin If there
Xis no subject, the message "<no subject>" will appear on
Xthe screen.
X.P
XFolders are indicated by having the folder name appear first
Xon the output line, as in:
X.nf
X
X   \fIfolder\fR: \fIsender name\fR - \fIsubject of message\fR
X
X.fi
XIf you're running \fInewmail\fR without the windows option,
Xthen the output is more suitable for popping up on an otherwise
Xactive screen, and will be formatted:
X.nf
X
X   >> New mail from \fIsender name\fR - \fIsubject of message\fR
X   >> Priority mail from \fIsender name\fR - \fIsubject of message\fR
X
X.fi
XAgain, with folder names indicated as a prefix.
X.P
XThe flags available are:
X.TP 1.0i
X.B "-d"
XThis will turn on the debugging, verbose output mode.  It is not
Xrecommended that you use this option unless you're interested in
Xactually debugging the program.
X.TP
X.B "-i \fIinterval\fR  "
XThis will change the frequency that the program checks the folders
Xto the interval specified, in seconds.  The default interval for
Xthe program is 60 seconds.  \fINote: if you change the interval
Xto less than 10 seconds, the program will warn you that it isn't
Xrecommended.\fR
X.TP
X.B "-w"
XUse of the ``-w'' flag will simulate having the program run
Xfrom within a window (e.g. the more succinct output format,
Xand so on).  Most likely, rather than using this option you
Xshould be simply invoking \fIwnewmail\fR instead.
X.P
X\fIFile specs\fR are made up of two components, the
X\fIfolder name\fR and the \fIprefix string\fR, the
Xlatter of which can always be omitted.
XThe format is \fIfoldername=prefixstring\fR, and
Xyou can specify folders by full name, by simply
Xthe name of the user whose mailbox should be 
Xmonitored, or by the standard \fBElm\fR 
Xmetacharacters to specify your folder 
Xdirectory (e.g. ``+'', ``='', or ``%'').
X.P
XFolders that cannot be opened due to permission mismatches
Xwill cause the program to immediately abort.  On the other
Xhand, files that do not exist will continue to be checked
Xevery \fIinterval\fR seconds, so some care should be 
Xexercised when invoking the program.
X.P
XThe program will run until you log out or explicitly kill

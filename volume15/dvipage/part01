 Dvipage is a program for previewing DVI files on Sun workstations.
 On a machine with a colour display, it renders each page of the
 document at high resolution and then filters and samples down the image
 to a lower spatial resolution, using grey scale resolution to maintain
 readability for the small character sizes. A magnifier is provided for
 close inspection of details of a page. On a monochrome display,
 these sampling features are not available, but rendering at low resolution
 is performed.
 
 This program is a significant development from the dvisun program
 which is in common use, offering improved user interfaces as well as
 advanced display features.
 
 The principle limitation of the current version is that it uses the PXL
 font description files, rather than any of the more compact forms
 which are available.
 
 Note that parts 2, 3 and 4 of this shar archive describe parts
 of the same file (dvipage.c) and must be unshared in order.

XYou will need to have a set of 300dpi fonts (for colour machines)
Xand 118 dpi fonts (for monochrome machines) in PXL format in some
Xdirectory.  (Talk to a metafont guru to find out how to make the fonts,
Xif necessary.)
X
XEdit the Makefile to set FONT_AREA, PRINT_SPOOLER and PRINT_PAGE_SPOOLER
Xcorrectly.
X
XFONT_AREA should point to the PXL file directory, for example
X	-D'FONTAREA="/usr/local/font/tex/pxl"'
X
XPRINT_SPOOLER and PRINT_PAGE_SPOOLER should define suitable commands
Xfor printing the whole document or a single page; they are used as below:
X	sprintf(command, PRINT_SPOOLER, filename);
X	sprintf(command, PRINT_PAGE_SPOOLER, page, page, filename);
XThere is currently no good, generic way to lpr a single page of a DVI
Xfile; the `texpagefilter' program in the model in the Makefile is a
Xconceptual program rather than something you will find today;
Xif someone wants to write one...
XA more practical version (for laserwriter users) is
X	-D'PRINT_PAGE_SPOOLER=dvips %s >/dev/null 2>/dev/null'
X	-D'PRINT_PAGE_SPOOLER=dvips -f %d -t %d %s >/dev/null 2>/dev/null'
Xor for imagen users
X	-D'PRINT_PAGE_SPOOLER=dviimp %s >/dev/null 2>/dev/null'
X	-D'PRINT_PAGE_SPOOLER=dviimp -S %d -E %d %s >/dev/null 2>/dev/null'
X
XIf your site uses several kinds of printers, you could add code in main()
Xto parse the PRINTER environment variable, and set appropriate commands for
Xprinting documents and pages. See for example the few lines bracketed
Xbetween `#ifdef SPAR_HACKS' in the function main() in dvipage.c
X
XRun  `make dvipage' and install it in the proper place (perhaps /usr/local/bin).
XInstall the manual page in the proper place (perhaps /usr/local/man/man1).

X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.IX dvipage "" "\fLdvipage\fR \(em display DVI files from TeX and LaTeX."
X.I Dvipage
Xdisplays DVI files produced by TeX or LaTeX on a SunView window.
XA new window is created, and the first page of the document is displayed.
XThe image of the page can be scrolled around in the window by
Xgrabbing it with the middle mouse button, or by the keystrokes
X.I "l r u d" (left, right, up, down).
XThe
X.I space
Xkey or the keys
X.I RET
X.I n
Xor
X.I +
Xadvance the display to the next page,
Xwhile the
X.I LF
X.I p
Xand
X.I -
Xkeys go back to the previous page.
XThe right mouse button invokes a menu with options to
Xmove forward or backward one page, to go to the first or last page
Xin the document,
Xto reopen the same, or a different, DVI file,
Xto print either one page, or the whole document,
Xor to exit.
XVarious other key and menu options are described below.
X.PP
XOn a monochrome display,
X.I dvipage
Xuses a set of low resolution fonts, (typically 118 dots per inch),
Xto display the text.
XWhen a colour display is available,
Xhigh resolution fonts are used, (typically 300 dpi),
Xthe page is rendered onto an internal ``page'',
Xand image processing functions are invoked to
Xlow pass filter the data and sample it down to a lower resolution.
XThe sampled data has substituted grey scale resolution for
Xspatial resolution, and retains much better readability than
Xsimple binary fonts at the same scale of display.
XOn a colour display, four levels of sampling are possible,
Xwith linear scales of 1, 2, 3 and 4.
XThe default is a sampling factor of 4.
X(Sampling factor 3 actually obtains three samples for each eight
Xpixels horizontally and nine rows vertically, thus changing
Xthe aspect ratio slightly.)
X.PP
XWhen a non unity sampling factor is used (the default on a colour display),
Xa magnifier is available to inspect a local region of the high resolution
Xunsampled data, by pressing the left mouse button.
XThe magnifier my be dragged around the page by moving the mouse with the
Xbutton down.
X.SH OPTIONS
X.PP
X.TP
X.B \-H
XPrints a simple help message.
X.TP
X.BI \-v " mode"
XSets a verboseness level for debugging (wizards only).
X.TP
X.B \-m
XMakes
X.B dvipage
Xthink that it is running on a monochrome machine even if it finds
Xa colour display.
X.TP
X.B \-p
XNormally
X.B dvipage
Xseeks to the end of the DVI file and reads the cached font data located
Xthere.
XThe
X.B \-p
Xoption suppresses this behaviour, causing the font data to be obtained
Xfrom the inline locations.
XThis is much slower, especially when skipping pages,
Xbut does allow the first few pages of a very long document to be
Xpreviewed before TeX has finished writing the DVI file
X(dangerous -
X.B dvipage
Xcrashes if it overtakes the end of the file !)
X.TP
X.B \-q
XCertain errors detected by
X.B dvipage
Xare displayed in a pop up message window.
XThe
X.B \-q
Xflag suppresses the generation of these windows.
X.TP
X.B \-f
XTeX has a concept of a rendering window with margins one inch
Xinside the edges of the paper;
Xthe DVI coordinate system is relative to this frame.
XAlthough it is possible (and even normal) to print outside
Xthe boundaries of this frame, sometimes it is useful
Xto see its location on the page.
XThe
X.B \-f
Xoption causes the rendering frame to be shown on the page display.
X.TP
X.BI \-r " res"
XCauses
X.B dvipage
Xto use fonts at a resolution of
X.I res
Xdots per inch.
XIf this is not a suitable size, it will generate many
Xerror messages as it fails to find font files at the specified
Xresolution.
XCommon sizes are 118 and 300 dots per inch.
XIf this option is ommitted,
X.B dvipage
Xwill select the either the high resolution fonts (on a colour machine)
Xor the low resolution fonts (on a monochrome machine).
X.TP
X.BI \-s " sample"
XCauses
X.B dvipage
Xto use a sampling factor of
X.I sample.
XIf this is not one of (1, 2, 3, or 4) a blank page will result.
XThis option is ignored if running on a monochrome machine.
X.TP
X.BI \-x " x " \-y " y"
XThe position of the top left hand corner of the page
Xfrom the top left hand corner of the display window,
Xmeasured in inches,
Xis set to be
X.I "(x, y)"
Xat the ``home'' position (the position at which each new page is displayed
Xbefore moving it around with the mouse).
X.TP
X.BI \-X " X " \-Y " Y"
XNormally the origin of the rendering window is set to be one inch
Xfrom the corner of the page.
XThis can be overriden by this option to match the actual behaviour of
Xyour local printer.
X.TP
X.BI \-w " w " \-h " h"
XSets the width and height of the paper on which the image is rendered;
Xthe default is 8\(12 \mu 11 inches. Useful for viewing legal size or A4 size
Xdocuments.
X.SH COMMANDS
X.PP
XThe following keystrokes typed to the display window execute
Xvarious commands.
XSome of these can be performed from a menu option.
XMany of the commands can be preceeded by a number,
Xindicated by
X.B #
Xin the description below.
X.TP
X.B MS_MIDDLE
XThe middle mouse button drags the page beneath the window to pan or scroll.
X.B MS_LEFT
XThe left mouse button invokes a magnifier on the page near the mouse,
Xwhen running in sampled mode on a colour display.
X.TP
X.B space, RET, n, or +
XAdvance to the next page in the document.
X.TP
X.B NL, p, or -
XGo back to the previous page.
X.TP
X.BR _ " (underscore)"
XGo to the first page in the document.
X.TP
X.B # g
XGo to page number
X.B #.
X(If
X.B #
Xis ommitted, go to the last page in the document.)
X.TP
X.B # G
XGo to sheet number
X.B #.
X(If
X.B #
Xis ommitted, go to the last page in the document.)
X.TP
X.B h
XReturn the page to the home position.
X.TP
X.B l, r, u or d
XMove the page left, right, up or down in the window by a small increment.
X.TP
X.B m
XMark the current page position as the new home page position for subsequent
Xnew pages and
X.B h
Xcommands.
X.TP
X.B S
XPops up a window in which a sampling factor can be typed.
XThis should be 1, 2, 3 or 4.
XClose the window by mousing the
X.B Abort
Xbutton or the
X.B OK
Xbutton,
Xor by typing
X.B "^C"
X(for abort)
Xor
X.B "ESC"
X(for OK).
X.TP
X.B # s
XSet a scaling factor of
X.B #.
X.TP
X.B # R
XReopen the current DVI file on page
X.B #.
X(If
X.B #
Xis ommitted, reopen on the current page.)
X.TP
X.B P
XPrint the DVI file on the default printer.
X(Invokes site dependent printer commands where possible,
Xotherwise just calls
X.B "lpr -d"
X.TP
X.B "^P"
XAttempts to print the current page on the default printer.
XThis requires site dependent printer commands to have
Xbeen specified when
X.B dvipage
Xwas installed.
X.TP
X.B w
XToggles the display of the rendering frame window.
X.B # x
XSets the width of the magnifier (in pixels).
X.B # y
XSets the height of the magnifier (in pixels).
X.B # b
XSets the width of the border drawn around the magnifier.
XUse
X.B 0 b
Xto have no border. displayed.
X.TP
X.B # v
XSets verbose mode
X.B #.
X.TP
X.B q
X.B dvipage
Xquits.
X.SH SEE ALSO
Xdvips(1)
X.SH BUGS
X.PP
XThe command to print the current page is rather
Xcrude. It needs special magic at installation time
Xto make it work.
X.PP
X.B Dvipage
Xchecks the modification time of the dvi file before tackling each page,
Xand refuses to proceed if you have reformatted the document, until you
Xinstruct it to reopen the file.
XHowever, if you reformat \fIwhile\fP it is in the process of reading a page,
Xit will probably crash messily.
X.PP
X.B Dvipage
Xstill uses the old style PXL files; it has not been updated to
Xread to more compact formats which are in use at some sites.
X.SH AUTHOR
X.PP
XThe original idea for this program came from
X.B dvisun
Xdeveloped by Mark Senn, Stephan Bechtolsheim, Bob Brown,
XRichard Furuta, James Schaad, Robert Wells, and Norm Hutchinson,
Xwith some bug fixes by Rafael Bracho at Schlumberger;
Xand from the program
X.B suntroff
Xdeveloped by Malcolm Slaney at Schlumberger.
X.PP
X.B Dvipage
Xwas put together by
XNeil Hunt at Schlumberger Palo Alto Research,
X.B hunt@spar.slb.com,
Xusing code borrowed from
X.B dvisun
Xand greatly extended.
XIn particular the filtering and sampling concept
Xand the fast code to implement it, and the magnifier,
Xcame from Neil Hunt.

X.SH NAME
Xvn - visual news reader
X.SH SYNOPSIS
X.I vn [options]
X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.I Vn
Xis a news reader which uses the same 
X.B .newsrc
Xfile as
X.I readnews
X(1), but displays and interacts differently.  It is aimed at allowing
Xyou to rapidly scan a large number of newsgroups, looking for something
Xyou want to read.  The major premise is that you will be interested in a
Xsmall number of articles, but will be interested in keeping tabs on a large
Xnumber of newsgroups which may contain something interesting from time to time.
XIt also has the ability to unpackage digests.
X.sp
XAs with other readers,
Xoptions may be given on the command line, in which case they will
Xsupersede those given in the
X.B .newsrc
Xfile.
X.SH OPTIONS
X.I Vn
Xsupports the -n, -x and -t options of
X.I readnews
X(specify newsgroup, read all articles, and specify title).
XIn addition, there some other options: -U, -S, -%, -w, -t and some options
Xbeginning with +.  The "+" options are not recognized within the
X.B .newsrc
Xfile, only on the command line, and are intended for use in environments
Xwith multiple NNTP installations.  If you are not using an NNTP version,
Xor only have one news installation accessible from a given machine, they
Xare probably of little use.
X.sp
XThe -w (writer
Xor author) option which works like -t, but is a search string to
Xapply to the "From" header line rather than the subject.  In the -n, -t
Xand -w options, a leading "!" on the string is taken to mean negation.
XThe rest of the string is a regular expression for the -w and -t options.
X.sp
XFor example:
X.sp
X-n net.dogs -w !fred -t [Bb]eagle
X.sp
XSelects articles in net.dogs about beagles written by somebody other
Xthan fred.  Multiple -w -t options are treated as follows:
X.in +5
X.sp
XIf the article satisfies any of the negations, you won't see it,
Xregardless of the non-negated options.
X.sp
XMultiple -w options are logically "or'ed", as are multiple -t's.
X.sp
XIf both -w and -t are present, the article is seen only if it satisfies
Xat least one of the -w's and at least one of the -t's, i.e. the results of the
Xlogical "or's" of the -t's and of the -w's are logically "anded" together.
X.sp
X.in -5
XThe -n options allow the "all" convention, replacing ".all" by
X".*" before using the regular expression calls.  -n options are processed
Xin the order given so that subsequent, more specific, -n's may partially
Xundo the effect of previous "alls".  Note that the -n option
Xtreatment is slightly different than the
X.I readnews
Xtreatment which says that "foo" implies "foo.all".
X.I Vn
Xaccepts this incompatibility to allow you an easier way of saying JUST "foo"
Xwithout any of its subgroups.
X.sp
XThe -S option is useful in conjunction with command line -n options.  It is
Xreally not useful in the
X.B .newsrc
Xfile, but existed before the "+" options were added.
XFor command line -n options, the "!" unsubscriptions in
X.B .newsrc
Xare also ignored.  This allows you to override all subscription information
Xby command line specification.  -S will modify this behavior.
XIf you use an -S option on the command line,
Xthe "!" unsubscriptions will still be used.
X.sp
XThe -% option initially gives you the results of a "%"
Xcommand, rather than the page for the first newsgroup (see below).
XThis allows you to see what newsgroups are available before viewing any.
X.sp
XThe -U option says that when your
X.B .newsrc
Xfile is updated via answering "yes" to the update query on
Xexit or using control-W, newsgroups marked with "!" are to be updated too.
XNormally, these groups are left alone, i.e. updated only to the number that
Xwas already in your
X.B .newsrc,
Xor the lowest article number still around.
XYou may get flooded should you decide to resubscribe.
XIf you don't like this treatment, use -U.  Then, control-W and "yes" to
Xthe update on exit will update your unsubscribed newsgroups to the most
Xrecent article.
X.sp
XThe "+" options mainly deal with NNTP.  If you are not using
Xan NNTP version (will be printed in the version message on startup,
Xversion will either be "res" or "nntp"), the +l, +m and +t options
Xare not recognized.
X.sp
XThe +n option must be followed by a filename, and directly specifies the
X.B .newsrc
Xfile in a manner similar to the NEWSRC variable, which it will override
Xif defined.
X.sp
XThe +m option must be followed by a machine name, and specifies the
Xmachine to talk the news installation on.  This will normally default
Xto some site-determined machine, and may also be set via the VNMACHINE
Xvariable.  The option overrides the variable, if defined.  Note that
Xthis is useful only if you have multiple news INSTALLATIONS accessible
Xfrom your machine, ie. different spooling areas with possibly different
Xsets of articles and different newsgroups based on which machine you
Xcommunicate with to obtain the news.  A majority of sites will not
Xhave this situation, so if you find the explanation confusing, ignore it.
X.sp
XThe +l option makes an NNTP version behave in a non-NNTP fashion, ie.
Xit directly reads the articles and newsgroup information, rather than
Xcommunicating with NNTP.  An empty string for VNMACHINE corresponds to
Xthis.
X.sp
XThe +t option must be followed by a filename, and will cause a trace
Xof the interaction with the NNTP server to be collected into it.
XPrimarily useful for somebody installing the program.
X.SH "USER INTERFACE"
XWhen
X.I vn
Xis invoked,
Xthere will be a pause (with an explanatory "reading" message and
Xa series of newsgroup names) while 
X.I vn
Xreads the news.  The newsgroups listed
Xare ones articles are actually being found in.
XThe length of the pause depends
Xon how much news there is.  If there is a lot,
Xit may take a long time to get through the reading phase.
XIf this is the first time you are using
X.I vn,
Xor if you are starting with an empty 
X.B .newsrc
Xfile,
Xthis may take a 
X.I very
Xlong time;
Xthere is a
X.I lot
Xof news out there.
X.sp
XOnce the reading phase is over, interaction is rapid.
XIf
X.I vn
Xis backgrounded, it suppresses the "reading" output, so
Xthat it will not halt on tty output until it is ready to begin showing
Xarticles.
X.sp
X.I Vn
Xmay show you a list of newsgroups which were not mentioned in the
X.B .newsrc
Xfile.  Records for these newsgroups will be added
Xto your 
X.B .newsrc
Xfile, whether
Xthey were scanned for articles or not.  The first time
X.I vn
Xis used, the list may be quite long and scroll off the screen.
XThereafter, there should only be a list when new newsgroups are
Xcreated.  This display serves to let you know of their existence,
Xor of something happening to your
X.B .newsrc
Xfile.
X.sp
XThe basic display is a "page" which shows a newsgroup and a list of
Xtitles, number of
Xlines, and authors for new articles.
XArticles which have been updated in the
X.B .newsrc
Xfile  are flagged with an underscore preceding the article number.
XYou also have the ability to "mark" articles for the duration of a session;
Xthis is
Xshown with an asterisk.
X(Columns 1 and 2 are reserved for asterisk and
Xunderscore respectively.
XIn normal usage they will be blank, so that the casual user will probably
Xbe unaware of their use until marking and updating are invoked.)
X.sp
XThere is a help menu to go with this page.
XYou may read articles, save them, or send them to the printer, either by cursor
Xposition, the whole page, or in specified sets.  Sets are specified either
Xas a set of article numbers, a regular expression to match the subject /
Xauthor / number of lines data on, or an asterisk to indicate the choice
Xof a set of previously marked articles.  Any of these methods also
Xaccept a leading "!" to indicate negation.
X.sp
XWhen you read articles only a couple of the dozen or so
Xheader lines are
Xshown.  There is an option to allow you to see all the
Xheader lines when you read articles.  The command controlling this toggles
Xbetween the two states.
X.sp
XA similar toggle is used to support ROT13 encryption.
X.sp
X.I Vn
Xis capable of manipulating digests.  The "d" command unpacks a digest
Xand presents you with a page showing the unpacked articles.
XThese can then
Xbe accessed the same way as articles on normal newsgroup pages.
XWhen you leave the digest page(s), you reenter the normal flow of newsgroups.
XDigests can also be read as normal articles, of course.
X.sp
XThe order of page presentation is determined by
Xorder of the group lines in the
X.B .newsrc
Xfile.
XNewsgroups which are not
Xmentioned in
X.B .newsrc
Xwill be added, as mentioned previously, at then end of the file.
XLines corresponding to non-existent newsgroups will be deleted.
XYou will probably want to run
X.I vn
Xonce, then edit your
X.B .newsrc
Xfile
Xto the desired order of presentation.
X.sp
XUpdating the data for
X.B .newsrc
Xis under user control.  If you do
Xno "W", "w", "^w", "o" or "O" commands, no updating takes place,
Xand you'll see the
Xarticles again the next time you read news.
XIf you quit without updating, you will be prompted to make sure you
Xthis is really what you
Xwant to do.
X.sp
XNote that "updating what you've seen" to
X.I vn
Xmeans that you've seen the page presentation, not that you've read the
Xarticle.  This is consistent with the overall assumption that you don't
Xwant to read most of what you are presented with.
X.sp
XBreaks result in a "really quit?" query, so you can recover from noisy
Xlines and prompts for commands you didn't really mean.  If you answer no,
Xyou are simply jumped back to the page.  Breaks while in the midst of scrolling
Xout an article you are reading jump you to the end of the article to stop
Xthe output.
X.sp
XCommands are single character (no return key required), except that
Xthey may be preceded with numeric characters, which may have
Xsome effect on their actions.  Commands which require further input
Xcause prompts for the information, this input being
Xterminated by return.  For prompted input, the erase and kill keys
Xwork.

XWhen you read articles there is another help menu for advancing through
Xthe articles, replying, posting followups, and saving the
Xarticles.  Breaks may be used to
Xstop the output of an article if you decide that you didn't really
Xwant to read it.  You can jump from the reading portion back to either
Xpage you came from or the NEXT page.
X.sp
XFor replying and posting followups, you will be placed in an editor
Xto create the reply or article.
XThe article will be included in the file you are editing, marked with
X"> "'s for excerpting in your reply or followup.  After exiting the
Xeditor you are prompted to make sure you still want to post or reply.
X.sp
XFor followups, your article is appended to "author_copy" for future
Xreference.
X(See CCFILE in the section on ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES).
X.sp
XHeader lines for the mailer / news poster are present in the file
Xyou are editing to allow you to modify them.  Remember to leave a blank
Xline between the header lines and your text.  It may be OK if you
Xdon't, but why tempt fate.
X.sp
XThe editor is determined by your EDITOR or VNEDITOR variable, as for
X.I postnews.

X.fi
X.sp
XWhen articles are saved from anywhere, a few special conventions apply.
X.sp
XIf the name begins with "|", you are specifying
Xa pipe to feed the article(s) to, rather than a file.  No other interpretation
Xis done in this case.
X.sp
XIf you specify a name not beginning with "/", the article will be saved
Xwith reference to your original directory, or with reference to the VNSAVE
Xvariable (see below).
X.sp
XIf you embed a "%d" in the name, that
Xwill be replaced with the article number, or the first number in a list
Xof articles.
X.sp
XIf you prepend "w:" to the
Xname, you can force an overwrite instead of an append.  The colon prefix
Xmay be used to open the file with any mode you please, actually.  If you
Xreally WANT a colon in the name, specify "a:" ahead of it.  The colon
Xprefix is stripped off before any other filename interpretation.
X.sp
XBoth the VNSAVE variable and the save name may use a leading "~" to
Xindicate the user's home or "~name" for another user's home.  It is assumed
Xthat a slash will separate the tilde expression from the rest of VNSAVE, or
Xthe rest of the file name if there are further directories.
X.sp
XWhen you are prompted for a savefile name, the last non-pipe
Xname you used
Xis presented, so you may use your erase/kill keys to edit it.
X.sp
XOld search strings / pattern match strings are also presented for edit in the
Xsame manner.
X.sp
XIf you don't like the choice of command keys, you
Xmay change them (default choices - basic control in article
Xreader is ala 
X.I more
Xof course, the "j" and "k" on the page presentation are 
X.I vi
Xconvention, other page commands are somewhat 
X.I readnews
Xcompatible).
XIf you have a file named
X.B .vnkey
Xin your home directory this file will be read in order to obtain keystroke
Xtranslation.  The format is simple:
X.sp
XEach line begins with R or P indicating translation for the reader interaction,
Xor the page interaction (r and p accepted also).  Following the R or P is
Xa character, followed by an "=", followed by another character.  The character
Xon the left hand side of the equals sign is what you wish to input, and the
Xcharacter on the right hand side of the equals sign is what you wish to
Xtranslate it to.  No embedded spaces are allowed.
XLines not beginning with the proper characters are simply
Xignored, as are characters following the translated character.  Eg:
X.sp
X.in +5
XPd=j
X.br
XPu=k
X.in -5
X.sp
Xuses "u" and "d" instead of "j" and "k" on the page layout (presumably,
Xyou are also going to translate something else to "u" and "d" for the
Xunsubscribe and digest commands).  If you translate keys, it is up to you
Xto see that all commands can still be reached, and that former command keys
Xwhich are no longer used are mapped to something meaningless.  In particular,
Xyou are going to have difficulties if you make it impossible to input "q".  The
Xhelp menus will show the "new" keys, and bad mappings should show up as
Xmultiple definitions for the same key, or alternate mappings not showing
Xup on the help menu.
X.sp
XMapping the "=" key via "==" works.  Any keys not mentioned in the file
Xare translated to themselves.
X.sp
XControl keys are given as DECIMAL numbers with no backslashes or anything.
XThe decimal number is the ASCII code for the character, eg:
X.sp
X.in +5
XP24=12
X.br
XP12=?
X.in -5
Xuses "control-x" for the "control-l (formfeed)" refresh key, and maps the
Xcontrol-l to a "?".  BTW, mapping all undefined keys to "?" will mean that you
Xautomatically get the help display for any illegal key, should you wish for
Xsuch a thing.  The LAST one mapped will determine what key is given in
Xthe "? for help" lines, and the help display itself.
XRemembering that control-A through
Xcontrol-Z are ASCII codes 1 through 26 and delete = 127 may keep you from
Xhaving to consult an ASCII table.  Remember also that some controls, such
Xas control- C, Z, S or Q may be caught by the operating system for signal
Xgeneration or terminal control, and are thus unavailable.
X.sp
XBecause of arrow keys and the ability to prefix commands with counts,
Xnumeric characters and the escape key may not be used for page commands.
XAttempts to use them will simply do nothing.
X.sp
XControl keys are not available for the reader, except for newline,
Xbackspace, and tab.  The reason controls are filtered here has to do
Xwith nasty problems involving terminal mode switches on some systems,
Xspecifically a UTS frontend early versions were being used on.
X.sp
XIn either interaction, "return" and "linefeed" are mapped to the "newline"
Xcharacter at a level below the translation.  If you don't know the
XASCII for the "newline" char, it is recommended that you map both
XASCII 10 and 13 if you wish to map "return" to something.
X.SH FILES

X.SH BUGS
XNote that
X.I readnews
Xwill rearrange the order of
X.B .newsrc.
XIf you
Xinterleave use of it with
X.I vn,
Xorder selection gets hosed.
X.sp
XIf you've really taken advantage of the ability of 
X.I readnews
Xto skip
Xarticles in the middle of the spooling numbers, be warned that
X.I vn
Xdoesn't have it, and will
Xassume you've read the articles in the middle.
X.sp
XIf the
X.B .newsrc
Xfile indicates that you've read articles in a newsgroup with a higher
Xnumber than the current spooling number for that newsgroup,
X.I vn
Xwill show you up to 60 old articles.  This is intended for recovery in
Xcases where article spooling has been reset, or to avoid missing articles
Xbecause you just changed machines and didn't bother to edit your
X.B .newsrc
Xfile.  Rather than miss stuff, you'll see some old stuff again.  During
Xthe reading phase, a warning message is printed that this is happening.
X.sp
XSometimes a "break" during reading an article will not only halt the
Xarticle but suppress the prompt.  A command character will work anyway.
X.sp
XIf a prompt to be displayed on the dialogue line
Xcontains non-printing sequences, stuff on the
Xline may not get erased when you are prompted, because
X.I vn
Xthinks the string is long enough to overprint its current contents.
XThis usually comes up when you have escape sequences in your UNIX
Xprompt, and do a "!" command.
XThe "overprint" check is made to save a clear-line sequence (kludged in
Xby overprinting to the end with blanks if the terminal doesn't
Xhave one - annoying at 1200 baud).
X.sp
XOutput during the reading phase which was suppressed by backgrounding
X.I vn
Xdoes not get started by foregrounding it again without doing a
Xcontrol-z and a second foreground (it doesn't figure out its background /
Xforeground status on each output - only on startup and while handling
Xthe SIGTSTP signal).  Actually, this results in a method for having
X.I vn
Xdo its reading phase silently in the foreground without redirecting
Xoutput, should such a thing be desired.
X.sp
XVery many -w or -t options cause SLOW reading phases.  It is recommended
Xthat these be used only when reading a few specific groups.
X.sp
XDigest extraction will split a single article into several if it contains
Xembedded ---- lines, the normal separator between articles in digests.
XThey will all have identical titles.
XDigest extraction may not work with human built digests which don't
Xuse the expected syntax for joining articles.  Mod.computers.ibm-pc
Xand mod.computers.mac were used as models for the feature.
X.sp
XThe data given by the % command represents the difference between the
Xlast article number you've updated to in a newsgroup and the high
Xarticle number.  This may be significantly greater than the number of
Xactual articles for a newsgroup you haven't been reading, and for
Xnewsgroups that have had a lot of articles filtered out of them using
Xthe -w and -t options.  The numbers given for menu selection in the

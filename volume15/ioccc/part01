Last year, the complete set of winners were posted because of the new
presentation method. (makefiles, hint files, etc...)  We received a
number of comments/suggestions/flames that result in a number of
small changes all over the place.  The result is a much improved
set of winners.

I would like to repost the complete set of winners again.  I doubt
that a reposting of all years will be needed in the future, just
a year by year change.

I think a note of the form:

	This posting contains a number of editorial and technical
	corrections.  Replace previous International Obfuscated C 
	Code Contest sources with these sources.

would be useful at the top of the README, 198{4,5,6,7} artciles.
The 1988 artcile file could have a note of the form:

	The rules for 1989 will be posted in beginning of March 1989 to
	the following groups: comp.lang.c & comp.unix.wizards.  Please
	wait until the 1989 rules are posted before sending in new
	entries as the rules change slightly from year to year.

Shar files follow.

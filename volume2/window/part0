To install WM:

1) Install the provided version of the Curses library. This library
   has bug fixes *necessary* to the proper operation of WM.
   If you don't actually install libcurses.a in /usr/lib, you
   must indicate this in the WM Makefile (the LIBCURSES macro),
   and you must copy the provided curses.h to this directory
   so that it will be included during compilation.

2) Set the value of BIN in the WM makefile to the
   directory where the WM program should reside.

3) Type 'make install'.

4) Install the WM manual page, wm.1, in the appropriate place.


Note 1: This version of WM is horribly 4.2bsd-dependent, using pseudo-ttys,
        the 'select()' system call, 4.2-specific ioctl's, etc.
        Conceivably, it could be made to run under 4.1bsd with some
        minor mods, but porting to other versions of UNIX would
        probably entail a major rewrite.

Note 2: The paper 'USINGWM' is a brief essay on how we use WM
	here at RTI, and should prove helpful in getting used to
	the WM style of doing things.  It also describes some
	problems/glitches with WM that you should be aware of.

Note 3: Included in this distribution is a paper (Paper.jacob)
        by the original WM author that describe WM's
        development and structure.  While the description of
        the 4.2bsd version of WM pertains to an earlier version,
        the basics are still the same, and this paper is good reading.

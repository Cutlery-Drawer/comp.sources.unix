Since I didn't hear from you for so long, I've started posting to
net.sources - today in fact.  I've only posted part 1 of the 6 so far.
What do you think we should do?  Repost all in mod.sources?  Only parts
2-6?  Stay in net.sources?  I might as well cancel it, I don't expect
that it has gotten very far yet.

Regarding "permission" from B. Kernighan - is his e-mail okay?  This is 
what I got from him:  (naturally, I have acceded to his request, and
have put copyright notices on all of the sources from the book).

    The programs in Software Tools [in Pascal] are
    copyrighted, so distributionn without permission
    is not legal.  Personal use is fair use, if I
    understand things properly.
    
    It looks like A-W is not really seriously interested
    in selling or distributing the Software Tools
    code these days, however,
    so Bill Plauger and I have decided that reasonable distribution
    through public networks, bulletin boards, etc.,
    should be permitted as an alternative.
    To protect our interest in the material,
    we would like each copy (per program at least) to retain a copyright
    notice indicating that the material
    comes originally from Software Tools [in Pascal], is copyrighted,
    and that subsequent copies should also retain the
    copyright notice.
    
    Naturally I'd like to encourage everyone to go out
    and buy a copy or two of the book.
    Given A-W's benign neglect of the code,
    we should do better with the increased interest coming
    from ready availability of the code.
    
    	Brian W. Kernighan

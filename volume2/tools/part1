Xfontinit.pascal contains a font definition - you should be able
Xto figure out how to build a driver for it.  It is in two pieces,
Xfontinit.A and fontinit.B (so that the batch is smaller than 50k).
XJust catenate them together.
X
XSome of these are from SWTiP, some I have written myself - these are
Xnoted in the headers.
X
XUsing this software (details for Pascal/VS on VM/CMS):
X	1) take the swtools.copy file:
X		convert it to Fixed 80
X		add line numbers in column 73-80
X		MACLIB it to SWTOOLS MACLIB
X	    swtools.copy is the complete set of include files required
X	    for building the tools. (from each *COPY to the next)
X	2) Compile all of the source that are "segment"s, and
X	   put the objects in a TXTLIB.
X	   These are library routines used by various programs.
X	3) Compile all of the source that are "program"s, and
X	   link them with TXTLIB.
X
XMVS users: you will have to change some of the I/O routines (the
Xones copyrighted by me) to use appropriate MVS functions.
X
XNon-Pascal/VS: you will have to convert the flavour of pascal to
Xwhat you have:
X	Pascal/VS supports separate compilations
X	Pascal/VS supports true strings (which I don't use much)
X	Pascal/VS supports includes
X	Pascal/VS supports fairly complicated initialized global
X		  data types, including binary constants.
X	You may have to throw out all of the I/O, some of the
X	include files, and include all of the routines for a given
X	program together.  Yech!  Good Luck!
X
XThis software is unsupported, however, upon request I may be able
Xto provide some hints.

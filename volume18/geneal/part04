X.SH NAME
Xgeneal \- A genealogy program
X
X.SH SYNOPSIS
X.br
Xgeneal [-e <commands>]
X
X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.I Geneal
Xis a program which reads a genealogy data file and produces output in
Xvarious formats.
XGeneal
Xknows how to produce the following types of output:
X.IP
XFamily pages (two formats).
X.IP
XBirthday and anniversary lists (sorted by month/day or by year/month/day).
X.IP
XTreepar-format output (for feeding to the treepar program to make
Xfamily history (ancestor), genealogy (descendant), or mixed charts).
X.IP
XSimple textual ancestor and descendant trees.
X.LP
XThere are a number of flags which control options in the
Xoutput.
X.LP
XIn addition to the output capabilities, geneal can be used to:
X.IP
XBrowse through the data file
X.IP
XCheck the consistency of references (e.g. parent/family/child) in the data file
X.LP
XNote that geneal is NOT used to maintain the data file.
XThe data file is a text file, and is maintained with any standard text editor.
X.LP
XGeneal uses the
X.I spin
Xinterpreter as a front end.
XControl of geneal is accomplished by entering simple or complex commands
Xto the spin interpreter, which parses and executes them.
XWhenever a geneal command is encountered, it is executed.
XGiven an understanding of the the spin interpreter and a list of the
Xgeneal functions, the full capabilities of geneal are available.
XThe list of geneal functions is described below.
X
X.SH SWITCHES
X.LP
XThere is only one command line switch, which is the
X.I -e
Xswitch.
XThe argument to this switch is a fragment of spin code to be executed.
XThis code fragment can contain any valid commands.
XWhen the execution is done, commands are then read from standard input.
XTypically the argument to the -e switch is a compound command which
Xexecutes the desired function and then exits.
XHere's an example of how the -e switch might be used:
X.LP
X% geneal -e '(GFlags "+btn")(PFamtree (LAnc 1092))(quit)'
X
X.SH ENVIRONMENT
X.LP
XGeneal uses the following environment variables:
X.TP
X.B GENEALDAT
XThe path to the data file to use.
XIf no environment variable is specified, geneal tries to open
Xthe file "geneal.dat".
X.TP
X.B GENEALLABEL
XSets the label to the value of this variable as if it were passed
Xto the function GSetLabel.
X.SH KEY CONCEPTS
X.LP
XGeneal reads its data from a file which is
Xorganized into records about individuals and families
X(described in more detail below).
XA family is defined to be a union of two individuals;
Xthus a family has exactly one father, one mother, and
Xzero or more children.
XNote that a "family" in geneal is not necessarily the same
Xas a real-life family.
XIt is more appropriate to think of a geneal family merely as
Xa union between a man and a woman.
XThis may be a contractual union, such as a marriage, or a
Xde facto union which produced children, independent of whether
Xthe couple was married.
X.LP
XEach record in the data file has associated with it a unique id
Xnumber (assigned manually by the creator of the file).
XThese numbers are used within the data file to refer to other records,
Xand within geneal functions.
XID numbers need not be ordered or consecutive.
X.LP
XWithin each individual record may be references to family records
Xfor spouse and parents.
XWithin each family record may be references to husband, wife, or
Xchildren.
XThese two record types may also refer to other record types
X(address or reference), which may refer back to them.
X.LP
XMany of the geneal functions accept a list of record id numbers, and
Xperform an operation upon that set of records.
XThese lists are typically generated by a set of list generation and
Xmanipulation functions, and then passed on to the output function.
XThus, for example, a single lineage from person A to person B
Xcan be easily generated by taking
Xthe intersection of the descendants of person A with the
Xancestors of person B.
XSince the spin interpreter maintains variables, fairly complex
Xcombinations of id lists can be incrementally
Xcreated by taking various combinations
Xof lists.
X
X.SH GENEAL FUNCTIONS
X.LP
XAll of the geneal functions take as operands either integers, strings, or
Xlists of integers;
Xall functions return either an integer, a string, or a list of integers.
XIn the descriptions below, these three types of data are indicated by
Xthe letters i, s, and L appended to the operand name.
XA type of I means an optional integer argument.
X.LP
XList generation and manipulation routines:
X.TP
X.B LAll    
XReturns list of all records in the data file.
X.TP
X.B LAnc idlist.L limit.I
XReturns a list of all the ancestors of the given families or individuals
Xin the idlist.
XIf a limit is specified, it indicates the number of additional generations
Xto return (e.g "2" means return the input list plus all parents and
Xgrandparents of anyone in that list).
XIf no limit is specified, all known ancestors are included.
X.TP
X.B LDesc idlist.L limit.I
XReturns a list of all the descendants of the given families of individuals.
XIf a limit is specified, it indicates the number of additional generations
Xto return (e.g "2" means return the input list plus all children and
Xgrandchildren of anyone in that list).
XIf no limit is specified, all known descendant are included.
X.TP
X.B LRefs idlist.L fieldname.s
XReturns a list of all the id numbers referenced by the specified field
Xin all entries in the idlist.
XFor example, to find all the children of a group of families, the fieldname
Xwould be "C".
X.TP
X.B LFieldMatch idlist.L fieldname.s matchvalue.s
XReturns a list of all the id numbers in the input idlist which have a field
Xfieldname which matches the value given by fieldvalue.
XExample: to get a list of all family records in the data file, use the
Xcompound statement (LFieldMatch (LAll) T F).
X.TP
X.B LRange from.i to.i
XReturns a list of all integers in the given range, inclusive.
X.TP
X.B LUnion a.L b.L
XReturns a list which is the union of the two input lists.
X.TP
X.B LIntersect a.L b.L
XReturns a list which is the intersection of the two input lists.
X.TP
X.B LAndNot a.L b.L
XReturns a list which contains all the numbers in list a
Xwhich are not in list b.
X.LP
XOutput routines:
X.LP
XThe output of all of the 'P' output routines is directed to a file
Xcontrolled by the command GSetOutput.
XBy default, output goes to stdout.
XFor the family and individual outputs, each family or individual
Xis separated by a string which is controlled by the command GSetSep.
XBy default, this string is a form feed.
X.TP
X.B PFamily fam_id.L
XPrints out a family page for each family in the list.
X.TP
X.B PFamilyh fam_id.L
XPrints out another style of family page for each family in the list.
XThe information about each individual is spread horizontally across the
Xpage.
X.TP
X.B PF fam_id.L
XEquivalent to PFamily.
X.TP
X.B PIndiv ind_id.L
XPrints out a data page for each individual in the list.
X.TP
X.B PI ind_id.L
XSame as PIndiv.
X.TP
X.B P id.L
XPrints out in PF format for each family, in PI format for each individual
Xin the list.
X.TP
X.B PAtree id.i
XPrints out a simple textual ancestor tree for the specified individual
Xor family.
X.TP
X.B PDtree id.i
XPrints out a simple textual descendant tree for the specified individual
Xor family.
X.TP
X.B PFamtree idlist.L
XPrints out information in treepar format about all families or individuals
Xin the list.
XThis output format is referred to as a famtree.
XThe output is suitable for feeding directly into the treepar program
Xfor producing charts.
XIf the idlist is generated with LAnc, this will give an ancestor chart;
Xif the idlist is generated with LDesc, this will give a descendant chart.
XOther more complicated charts can be created by using the list manipulation
Xfunctions to generate different kinds of lists.
X.TP
X.B PBDlist idlist.L
XPrints out a birthday list containing the birthdate and name of all the
Xindividuals in the list.
XThe list is sorted by month and day if the y flag is not set, or
Xby year, month and day if the y flag is set.
X.TP
X.B PAnnlist idlist.L
XPrints out an anniversary list containing the wedding
Xanniversary date and name of all the
Xfamilies in the list.
XThe list is sorted by month and day if the y flag is not set, or
Xby year, month and day if the y flag is set.
X.LP
XBrowsing routines:
X.LP
XAll of the browsing functions accept an optional integer argument.
XIf this argument is supplied, it sets the internally maintained
X"current" selection.
XIf the argument is not supplied, the internal current selection is
Xused as the argument.
XAll browsing functions return the id number of the current selection
Xas of the completion of that operation.
XThe browsing functions always output to the standard output,
Xindependent of the GSetOutput command.
X.TP
X.B TCurrent id.I
XPrints out a short information summary about the selection
Xand sets it to be the current selection.
X.TP
X.B TFamily id.I
XFollows the parent reference to the family record for the selection,
Xprints out information about that family,
Xand sets it to be the current selection.
X.TP
X.B TFather id.I
XFollows the husband reference of a family record or the husband
Xreference in the parent reference for an individual record,
Xprints out information about that individual,
Xand sets it to be the current selection.
X.TP
X.B TMother id.I
XFollows the wife reference of a family record or the wife
Xreference in the parent reference for an individual record,
Xprints out information about that individual,
Xand sets it to be the current selection.
X.LP
XMiscellaneous:
X.TP
X.B GFlags newflags.s
XSets or clears flags, according to the first character in the string.
XThe return value is a string which is a list of the flags which are
Xset after the execution of the command.
XIf the first character is a "+", each remaining character in the string
Xis considered a flag character and is set.
XIf the first character is a "-", each remaining character in the string
Xis considered a flag character and is cleared.
XIf the first character is a "=",
Xall flags are cleared, then each remaining character in the string
Xis considered a flag character and is set.
XIf the first character is a "?", no operation is performed, but
Xthe current list of flags which are set is returned as a string.
XIf the first character is a "h", a help message is printed.
XA list of the flags and what they control is given below.
X.TP
X.B GSetLabel newlabel.s
XSets a string to be output on family pages and treepar trees.
X.TP
X.B GGetLabel
XReturns the current value of the label.
X.TP
X.B GVersion
XReturns a string which is
Xthe current version number and date of the geneal program.
X.TP
X.B GSetOutput filename.s
XSets the output for all 'P' commands.
XIf a previous file was opened, it is flushed and closed first.
XIf the first character of the filename is a '+', the file will be
Xappended to.
XIf the filename is stdout or stderr, output goes to that stream
Xrather than to a file by that name.
XThe output is initially set to stdout.
XReturns 1 if the file was opened successfully, 0 if not.
X.TP
X.B GGetOutput
XReturns the filename of the last successful GSetOutput command.
X.TP
X.B GFlushOutput
XFlushes the output file.
XDoes not close it.
X.TP
X.B GSetSep sepstr.s
XSets the separator string which is output between items (families or
Xindividuals) in the 'P' output routines.
XThe separator string is initially set to a form-feed.
X.TP
X.B GGetSep
XReturns the current separator string.
X.TP
X.B GConsist
XChecks the consistency of the data file; verifies that families which
Xreference children are also referenced as parent family by the child, etc.
XPrints out some statistics about the data it checked.
X
X.SH FLAGS
X.LP
XThere are a number of flags which control various output options.
XThese flags are set by the function GFlags, described above.
XThe current state of the flags can be examined with the command
X(GFlags "?").
XA help message describing what the flags do is printed by the command
X(GFlags h).
XThe flags and their function are:
X.TP
X.B a
XEnables the output of addresses in family pages and famtrees.
X.TP
X.B b
XEnables the printing of additional birth and death information in famtrees.
X.TP
X.B m
XIncludes spouses in famtrees (useful for descendant trees).
X.TP
X.B n
XEnables printing of index numbers in all P output routines.
X.TP
X.B N
XEnables additional printing of index numbers in all P output routines.
X.TP
X.B s
XEnables printing of sibling information in atrees (PAtree).
X.TP
X.B t
XIncludes TNOTEs (or TGENs) in famtrees.
X.TP
X.B y
XEnables the inclusion of years when sorting dates in birthday
Xand anniversary lists.
XWhen not set, these lists are sorted by month and day only.
X.TP
X.B D
XA debug flag for low level data reading routines.
X.TP
X.B I
XA debug flag for low level index routines.
X
X.SH DATA FILE FORMAT
X.LP
XThe format of the data file was designed to make it simple to maintain
Xfile with any standard text editor.
X.LP
XWithin a data file there are "records".  A record is a group of
Xassociated information; it corresponds to a "row" in a relational
Xdatabase system.  Within the record there are "fields", which
Xcontain the individual items of data.  A field more or less
Xcorresponds to a "column" in a relational system.  Each field
Xis composed of a "keyword" and a "value".  The keyword and the
Xvalue are separated by a colon (:); each field is on one line;
Xand each record is separated by one or more empty lines (that
Xmeans no spaces or tabs on the line either).
X.LP
XIn addition to obeying the rules indicated above, note also the following:
X.IP
XKeywords consist only of alphanumeric characters, underscore,
Xand dot, with
Xthe first character being alphanumeric.  Spaces and punctuation are
Xnot allowed in keywords, and will cause that line to be considered
Xas a continuation line rather than a keyword line (see below).
X.IP
XThere are no spaces before or after the colon which separates the
Xkeyword and the value: a space before would cause the keyword not
Xto be recognized;
Xa space after would be seen as a part of the value.  Likewise
Xthere are no trailing spaces on the values.
X.IP
XNot all records must have all fields.  If a record is missing a field,
Xits value will be null (i.e. ""), which can easily be tested for if desired.
X.IP
XComment lines can be included by starting the line with a colon.
XAs many comment lines can be included as desired.
X.LP
XWhen editing a geneal data file, be very careful about spaces.  In particular,
Xbe sure that the empty lines which separate the records really are empty,
Xand do not have even one space one them.  If one of these "empty" lines is
Xnot really empty, it will cause the two records to be seen as one.
XWhen a line has trailing blanks on it, a warning message is output
Xwhich gives the line number.
XThe error messages are also output to an error file, whose name is the
Xname of the data file with ".error" appended to it.
XThese errors should be fixed before
Xproceeding, since ignoring them may lead to the above problems.
XNote that these error messages are only output when the index is
Xbeing generated, which normally happens only once after each time
Xthe data file is edited (see the discussion about index files below).
X.LP
XIt is sometimes desirable to have a value in a field which is more than
Xone line long.  This can be done.  The value in a field can be continued
Xonto the next line by starting that line with a plus mark (+).  This
Xcharacter will not be a part of the value, but indicates to geneal
Xthat the value on the preceding line is being continued on this line.
XThere are other ways to make continuation lines: if a line
Xis not blank, does not begin with a colon, and does not
Xbegin with a keyword immediately followed by a colon,
Xthen it is considered a continuation line.
XThis makes it easy to put in simple text in multiple lines, without the
Xnecessity of adding the leading plus sign; however, for safety and clarity,
Xit is suggested that the leading plus sign always be used for continuation
Xlines.
X.LP
XIf the first line of a record is a continuation line, that line (plus all
Xfollowing continuation lines) is put into a variable called "unnamed",
Xwhere it can be checked by a program segment if desired.
X.LP
XGeneal maintains an index file for each data file which
Xit accesses, in order to improve performance on large (over 500 records)
Xdatabase files.  If the database file is called "foo.db", then geneal
Xwill create an index file called "foo.db.index" in the same
Xdirectory as the data file.  If the index file already exists and is newer
Xthan the data file, then it is used; if the index file does not exist or
Xis older than the data file, then a new index file is created.
X.LP
XIn some cases it may not be possible to create a new index file.  This is
Xnot considered an error, geneal merely ignore the index file and scans
Xthe data file to build its internal index list.  This is to allow people
Xto use databases in directories in which they might not have write
Xaccess.  Similarly, if there is an error creating a ".error" file,
Xthat problem is silently ignored.
X.LP
XGeneal understands four different types of records: individuals,
Xfamilies, addresses, and references.
XThe type of a record is indicated by the "T" field, which has the value
X"I", "F", "A", or "R" for the known record types.
XThe remainder of the fields which are recognized by geneal depend on
Xwhat the record type is.

Xa comment by starting each line with a colon.
X
X.SH BUGS
X.LP
XThere are lots and lots of memory leaks.
X.LP
XThe only .A field which is supported is LN.A, and even there there
Xare sometimes formatting questions which arise when a person has
Xadopted multiple last names.
XIn particular, C.A and P.A are not supported; thus the data file can
Xrepresent adoption, but geneal can not do anything with it.
X.LP
XThe support for complex trees is not adequate; it is difficult to
Xgenerate the lists for complex trees, and not possible to specify
Xdifferent flags for different areas of the tree.

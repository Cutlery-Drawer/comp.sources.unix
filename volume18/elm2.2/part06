Xthat's reached, \f2use it!\f1  Soon you'll find
Xareas that you need to expand into, and you can
Xachieve that by going into the \f2o)ptions\f1
Xscreen within \f2elm\f1 and changing your
Xuser level accordingly.
XAfter a while, sit down again and read through this
Xguide.  You should have a couple of ``aha!'' intuitive
Xflashes.  After another period of time, you're
Xready to delve into the real power of the system
Xand read the reference guide.  The other manuals
Xshould be read as the need arises.
X
XIn any case, the system should be useable without reading
X\f2any\f1 of the documentation!
X
XAny comments or problems with any of the documentation or the program
Xitself are welcome; if you can't get electronic mail to me, please
Xfeel free instead to drop me a note via the overland mail address
Xin the title page.

X
XThere are a number of things to notice about this, the main screen;
X
X.lp \h'12p'\(bu 20p
XMost likely, on your computer the message currently ``active'' will be
Xdisplayed in an inverse bar rather than being delimited by the two
Xcharacter arrow as here.  It's nothing to worry about; displaying
Xinverse video is just quite difficult on printable guides!
X
X.lp \h'12p'\(bu 20p
XThe first line on the screen always displays the name of the current folder,
Xthe number of messages in the folder, and the current \f3Elm\f1 version number.
X
X.lp \h'12p'\(bu 20p
XThe arrow (``->'') or inverse video bar will always
Xindicate which is the current message.  
X
X.lp \h'12p'\(bu 20p
XThe first field that appears associated with each message is
Xthe status field.  This can be blank (as with most of the
Xones above, or can have any combination of the following:
X
XThe first character signifies temporary status:
X
X.ta .75iC 102p
X.nf
X	E	for an \f2expired\f1 message
X	N	for a \f2new\f1 message
X	O	for an \f2old\f1 (i.e. not new but not read) message
X	D	for a \f2deleted\f1 message
X
XThe second character which signifies permanent status:
X
X	U	for \f2urgent\f1 mail
X	A	for messages that have an \f2action\f1 associated with them
X	F	for a \f2form\f1 letter
X.fi
X
XThe third character of the status field can be a ``+'' to
Xindicate that the message is \f2tagged\f1 too.
X
X.lp \h'12p'\(bu 20p
XContinuing from left to right, the next field is the message
Xnumber.  For the most part you can ignore these unless you want
Xto quickly move to a specific message (as we'll see later).
X
X.lp \h'12p'\(bu 20p
XThe date associated with each message is typically
Xthe date the person actually \f2sent\f1 the message.  
X
X.lp \h'12p'\(bu 20p
XThe next field displayed indicates whom the message is from.  
X\f3Elm\f1 will try to display the \f2full name\f1 of the person who 
Xsent the message, rather than the their return address or computer login.  
XSome systems don't generate the correct headers, though, hence 
Xmessages like numbers 2 and 8, where it's their return address.
X
X.lp \h'12p'\(bu 20p
XThe number in parentheses is the total number of lines in the message.
X
X.lp \h'12p'\(bu 20p
XThe final field is the subject of the message.  Notice
Xthat messages might not have any subject, as in messages #9 and #10.
X
X.lp \h'12p'\(bu 20p
XA maximum of ten messages are displayed at one time\s-2\u1\d\s0.
X.fn
X1. On screens with greater than 25 lines, more messages will be 
Xdisplayed automatically.  Further, if you choose to turn off
Xthe Menu display, you can have an even greater number 
Xdisplayed.
X.ef
XFurther into the document we'll learn how to change ``pages'' in the folder. 
X
X.lp \h'12p'\(bu 20p
XThe three line Menu display will always 
Xindicate the relevant commands.  There are actually two possible 
Xmenus that can be displayed, based
Xon the \f2user level\f1 as set from either the o)ptions screen or
Xthe \f2.elm/elmrc\f1 
Xfile.  The alternate menu, for more advanced users, 
Xlists more options;

X.br 
Xne 5
X.sp
X.hn 1 Non-Interactive Uses of Elm
X
XBefore we go ahead and discuss the \f3Elm\f1 utilities, it's worth 
Xnoting that 
Xthere are a couple of other ways to use the main mail
Xsystem, namely to `send only' and to send files (batchmail).
X
XTo send a message to someone without any of the associated 
Xoverhead of reading in a mail folder. you can invoke the
Xmailer with the name(s) of the people to send to.  For example:
X.nf
X  $ \f3elm dave_taylor\f1
X.fi
XThe 
Xmailer will then prompt for Subject, Copies, and then drop
Xyou in your editor (defined in the \f2.elmrc\f1 file) to compose
Xthe message.   When composition is complete, the program 
Xverifies transmission then terminates.
X
X.ne 3
XThe mailer also supports batch type mailing, of files and so on,
Xby using the following command:
X.nf
X  $ \f3elm dave_taylor < help.c\f1
X.fi
Xwhich will read in the file and transmit it to the specified user.
X
X.ne 3
XA subject may be specified with ``-s \f2subject\f1'' as an option
Xto the program in either `send only' or `batch' modes, as in:
X.nf
X  $ \f3elm -s "File help.c, as promised" dave_taylor < help.c\f1
X.fi
X.br
X.ne 5
X.sp 
X.hn 1 The Elm Utilities
X
XThe \f3Elm\f1 mail system is really much more than a single
Xprogram for reading and writing mail.  It's a unified 
Xenvironment for intelligently dealing with electronic
Xcorrespondence.  As a consequence, it contains a number of other
Xprograms to aid in the easy processing of `email', 
Xincluding the following;
X
X.lp \h'10p'answer 1.0i
XAn answering-machine transcription program.  Please see the
Xmanual entry for more information on how to use this program.
X
X.lp \h'10p'autoreply 1.0i
XThis program, in conjunction with the ``arepdaemon'', enables users
Xto automatically reply to incoming mail when they're not directly
Xavailable.
X
X.lp \h'10p'checkalias 1.0i
XA script for checking aliases simply.
X
X.lp \h'10p'messages 1.0i
XA script that lists the number of messages in the specified 
Xfolder.  Suitable for login scripts and such.
X
X.lp \h'10p'newmail 1.0i
XThis program monitors a mailbox or set of mailboxes and can
Xoutput notification of new mail in one of two possible
Xformats; either:
X
X.ne 6
X.ft CW
X.ps 9
X>> New mail from Jimmy Carter - Urgent matters of state
X>> New mail from joe@ucbvax.arpa - Did I hear someone say PARTY??
X.ft 1
X.ps 10
X
Xif running as \f2newmail\f1 or:
X
X.ft CW
X.ps 9
XJimmy Carter -- Urgent matters of state
Xjoe@ucbvax.arpa -- Did I hear someone say PARTY??
X.ft 1
X.ps 10
X
Xif running as \f2wnewmail\f1.  BSD Users will find this is
Xa far superior \f2biff\f1 program.
X
X.lp \h'10p'wnewmail 1.0i
XThis is the same program as newmail, but has different
Xdefaults if invoked this way.
X
X.lp \h'10p'readmsg 1.0i
XThis handy little program can be used in two ways.  First off,
Xit can be used to easily read a specific message in the
Xincoming mailbox, specified by ordinal number, by a string that
Xthe message contains, by the metacharacter `$' which 
Xrepresents the last message in the folder, or `*' which matches 
Xall the messages in the folder.
X
XFor example;
X
X$ \f3readmsg 4 5 9 | lpr\f1
X
Xwould generate a printout, \f2sans\f1 superfluous headers, of the fourth,
Xfifth and ninth messages in your mailbox.
X
X$ \f3readmsg Carter | page\f1
X
Xwould be a fast way to read what `ole Jimmy has to say...
Xand
X
X$ \f3readmsg -h hear someone say\f1
X
Xwould list, including all the message headers, the message
Xcontaining the string ``hear someone say''.
X
X.lp \h'10p'frm 1.0i
XSimilar to the Berkeley \f2from\f1 command, this will
Xgive you a ``table of contents'' of either the current

Xbe if you have a large mailing list for a newsletter, say.
XThis command, \f2fastmail\f1, is designed just for that purpose.

X.hn 1 Credits and So on
X
XThis mailer has been evolving over the past few years with
Xinvaluable comments on the interface and general mail 
Xissues from the following people;
XJim Davis, Steve Wolf (or should that say Steve!! Wolf!!!! perhaps?),
XLarry Fenske, Rob Sartin,
XJohn Dilley and Carl Dierschow.
X.sp
XFor the Berkeley implementation, lots of help came from
Xboth John Lebovitz and Ken Stone.
X.sp
XFor the Amdahl/UTS implementation, thanks to Scott McGregor and
XStan Isaacs.
X.sp
XFor the Sun problems, Dave England in Lancaster (UK) turned out to be
X``bloody useful'', as he would no doubt say.
X.sp
XThe Pyramid version is due to the work of Steve Malone
Xof the University of Washington.
X.sp
XA number of other people have been amazingly disciplined at reporting 
Xproblems and (usually, much to my relief) indicating the fixes needed,
Xespecially Guy Hillyer, Bruce Townsend and Eric Negaard.
X.sp
XThere have been many, many others, too numerous to mention, that
Xhave inspired me with questions like "Why can't Elm..." or 
X"Why does it ..." or "Can we make it..." too.  A loud round of
Xapplause and an enthusiastic THANK YOU to you all!!
X.sp
XAlso helpful was the ability to have my `own' machine to 
Xclose up the many many iterative loops that this software
Xhas gone through \(em since being on a big multi-user machine
Xtends to slow it down to a standstill...
XFor that, I thank Hewlett-Packard Colorado Networks Division for their 
Xinitial support, and now HP Laboratories for the wonderful working 
Xenvironment that I have here (more than any one person is safe having, 
XI suspect).
X.sp
XMailers that have influenced the design and implementation of \f3Elm\f1, 
Xfor better or worse, include the following;
X
X.lp \h'4p'\f2/bin/mail\f1 1.0i
XThe most basic of mailers, this one was simply the example of how \f2not\f1
Xto force the user to interact with a program.
X
X.lp \h'4p'\f2Berkeley Mail\f1 1.0i
XA surprisingly sophisticated mailer, especially the version with 4.3 BSD,
X\f2Berkeley Mail\f1 still suffers from the tendency to force the user to
Xknow too much about the system, and also lacks a friendly, non-cryptic
Xinterface for the large subset of the population that use Unix but aren't
Xinterested in becoming a ``hacker''.
X
X.lp \h'4p'\f2MH\f1 1.0i
XThis is another nifty mailer.  The main difference between this and the
Xother mailers about is that it is a discrete set of programs rather than
Xa single unified interface.  This is quite useful for those people that
Xreceive \f2lots\f1 of mail and are willing to spend some time learning
Xthe intricacies of the program.  It's quite powerful, but again, misses some
Xof the basic friendly features the majority of users are interested in.
X
X.lp \h'4p'\f2dmail\f1 1.0i
XA sort of mutated cross between \f2MH\f1 and \f2Berkeley Mail\f1, it was
Xthis program that convinced me to implement the \f2Limit\f1 functions.
X
X.lp \h'4p'\f2NMail\f1 1.0i
X(a part of the HP AI Workstation Software Environment).  This program hints
Xat the power that mailers could be given to help deal with mail in a quick
Xand intelligent fashion.  Most of what it can do, and a lot more, are 
Xtherefore part of \f3Elm\f1.  Indubitably.  And quite faster too!
X
X.lp \h'4p'\f2PMX/TERM\f1 1.0i
XPart of the AT&T Mail package, a single glance at this interface convinced
Xme that a PC interface, with almost half of the screen taken up by a silly
Xfunction key mapping, is most certainly \f2not\f1 the way to do things!!
XOn the other hand, it also shows that the \f2Forms\f1 mode can be quite
Xnicely integrated into a more sophisticated mailer.
X
X.lp \h'4p'\f2fmail\f1 1.0i
XA nickel addition to the \f2/bin/mail\f1 program to add some rudimentary
Xscreen interface stuff, this nonetheless interesting mailer is part of 
Xthe AT&T Toolchest.
X
X.lp \h'4p'\f2Laurel\f1 1.0i
XA program only available within Xerox PARC, this was an interesting
Xearly attempt at a graphics based full-screen mail program.  The one,
Xperhaps trivial, part of the interface I really like was the fact that
Xit would \f2cross out\f1 a message that was marked for deletion.  One
Xday when we get real graphics and the ability to use them indicated in
Xa facility (not too) like \f2termcap\f1, perhaps \f3Elm\f1 will do 
Xthis too! 
X
X.lp \h'4p'\f2Mailtool\f1 1.0i
XPart of the Sun distribution package, this program is a really nice
Xexample of what can be done by putting a smart shell on top of a dumb
Xprogram \(em it uses \f2/bin/mail\f1 for all the `dirty work'.  Other than
Xthat, it's not a particularly interesting interface or mailer, and it
Xcertainly doesn't add much functionality!
X
X.lp \h'4p'\f2Metamail\f1 1.0i
XWhat can I say?  This isn't even a real mailer, but is just what I dream
Xof as an interface to mail in the future.  A program that works sort of
Xlike \f3HAL\f1 did in \f22001: A Space Odyssey\f1 \(em where it interrupts
Xme as appropriate for important mail, and can answer inane and other
Xqueries itself according to what I teach it.  Maybe \f3Elm\f1, by some sort
Xof groupmind metamorphosis, will change into that someday.  Maybe not.  Maybe
Xno-one bothers to read this far into the document!!
X
X.in 0
XFinally, it's also been a very useful experience overall,
Xconfirming my beliefs that iterative software design and
Xkeeping a close watch on users (not to mention an open
Xmind and mailbox!) improves a product manyfold.  Comments,
Xfeedback and bug reports (and fixes!) are, of course, always welcome!

X.SH NAME
Xanswer - phone message transcription system
X.SH SYNOPSIS
X.B answer
X.PP
X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.I Answer\^
Xis a part of the 
X.B Elm
Xmail system and is designed for secretaries and the like
Xto allow them to answer phones and|or listen to phone message
Xmachines and quickly and easily transcribe the messages into
Xelectronic mail.
X.P
XThe program uses its own alias set (usually a subset of the
Xsystem aliases, with more fields per user (ie unique first
Xnames, unique last names, first-initial lastname, and so on)).
XNote this means that you must create and then install, using
X.I newalias,
Xa separate alias table for the account this program is to 
Xbe run from.
X.P
XInterface-wise, the program is a breeze to use - type 'answer'
Xto start it up and then merely type a user name at the
X.nf
X	
X	Message to:
X
X.fi
Xprompt, and then enter the message, ending with a blank line.
XNames can be entered as 'Firstname Lastname' and the system
Xwill try to find a mail alias based on the first letter of the
Xfirst name plus the last name.  For example, 'Dave Taylor'
Xwill cause the program to search for an alias 'd_taylor' in
Xthe file (note the transliteration into lower case).   The 
Xprogram will loop until killed or quit.
X.P
X.I Answer
Xcan be easily exited by typing any of 'quit', 'exit' 'done', 
Xor 'bye' at the 'Message to:' prompt.

X.I filename
X.PP
X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.I Autoreply\^
Xis a part of \fBThe Elm Mail System\fR
Xand is designed to enable users to easily set up
Xan automatic response to all mail they receive.  This is
Xtypically during a vacation or some other period of time that
Xthe user is not available to reply to mail (although some
Xpeople get enough mail that they have it permanently running
Xto simply send an "ack" to each message)
X.PP
XThe system is quite easy to use...
XYou can type "autoreply" and be informed of your current
Xstatus in the system (on or off), or "autoreply off" will
Xturn your autoreplying off.
X.PP
XTo add yourself to the system, you need merely to compose a
Xform response in a file somewhere, then type "autoreply \fIfile\fR"
Xwhere \fIfile\fR is the name of the file.
X.SH "SPECIAL NOTE"
XFor this to function correctly, the program "arepdaemon" must
Xbe running as a daemon in background.  This program automatically
Xchecks all the currently enrolled users for new mail in their
Xmailboxes...

X.SH "BUGS"
XUnfortunately, this program isn't too brilliant about identifying
Xmail that shouldn't be responded to (like mail from other
Xdaemons, or your mother) but that's a more general problem anyway.
X.sp
XAlso, occasionally a user will remove themselves from the
Xautoreply system and the system won't turn their autoreply
Xoff.  This is a problem that hasn't been solved yet (obviously
Xsince it's in the "bugs" section!!) and any further information
Xwould be appreciated!

XNote that the precedence of aliases is user file then system
Xfile.  This means that a user can 'overload' an alias by having
Xone defined in the system file also defined in theirs.  This
Xshouldn't turn out to be a problem, but is something for
Xthe system administrator to keep in mind when creating the
Xsystem alias file.

X.SH DESCRIPTION
X.I Elm\^
Xis an interactive screen-oriented mailer program that supercedes 
X.I mail
Xand 
X.I mailx.
X.PP
XThere are three main ways to use the \fBelm\fR mailer.  One way
Xto use the mailer is to specify a list of addresses on the
Xcommand line when the mailer is invoked.  This will allow sending
Xof a single message to the specified recipients with all the
Xoptions usually available in the \fBelm\fR system itself. For example,
Xthe command
X.nf
X
X	elm -s testing joe
X
X.fi
Xwould initiate the sending of a message to the alias joe with the subject
X"testing" indicated and
Xwould put you into an editor for you to enter the text of the message.
XIf the subject flag and argument were not present, you would be prompted
Xfor a message subject.
X.PP
XThe second way, used most commonly when transmitting files and such,
Xis to specify the subject of the message and the recipients using
Xthe command line and redirect a file as standard input.  For example,
Xthe command 
X.nf
X
X	elm -s testing joe < test.c 
X
X.fi
Xwould mail a copy of the
Xfile test.c to alias joe, with the subject "testing" indicated.
XThe subject flag and argument are optional.
X.PP
XThe third way, elm is invoked
Xwith neither subject nor addresses specified on the command line and
Xwithout standard input redirected.
XYou can then read any messages in your incoming mailbox (or specified
Xfolder), reply to messages in the mailbox, mail messages, etc.
X.PP
XOptions are:
X.TP 1.0i
X.B "  -a"
XArrow - force the arrow cursor (instead of the inverse bar)
X.TP
X.B "  -c"
XCheckalias - expand the following aliases and return.
X.TP
X.B "  -d \fIlevel\fR  "
XDebug - set specified debug level - Output to "$HOME/Elm:debug.info"
X.TP
X.B "  -f \fIalternative-folder\fR  "
XFolder - read folder (specified) rather than the incoming mailbox.
X.TP
X.B "  -h"
XHelp - give a list of starting options.
X.TP
X.B "  -?"
XSynonymous with the "-h" option.
X.TP
X.B "  -k"
XKeypad - force knowledge of HP terminal keyboard, to allow
Xthe use of the NEXT, PREV and HOME/SHIFT-HOME keys.
X.TP
X.B "  -K"
XKeypad + softkeys - enable use of softkeys on HP terminals only.
X.TP
X.B "  -m"
XMenu off - Use the extra lines for more message headers.
X.TP
X.B "  -s \fIsubj\fR  "
XSubject - specify subject for message to mail.
X.TP
X.B "  -z"
XZero - don't enter \fBElm\fR if no mail is pending.

Subject:  v07INF8:  Index for Volume 7 and other info
Newsgroups: mod.sources
Approved: mirror!rs

Submitted by: 
Mod.sources: Volume 7, Info 8
Archive-name: index.4

This is the second of two articles.   The first listed the mod.sources
archive sites around the world, and the contents of the archives for
volumes one through six.  This latter part of this article lists all
articles published so far in volume seven.

Items intended for posting should be sent to mirror!sources; requests
for missing copies or other queries should be sent to
mirror!sources-request.  In Australia, Robert Elz is a "sub-moderator";
people there can work with him (kre@munnari.OZ) to get postings out
more easily.

Because of a number of reasons, the backlog is in postings is
"unforgivably large" (almost a month). I will slightly accelerate the
flow until I am caught up.  I apologize for this, and hope no one
decides to turn elsewhere for posting their sources.

When sources are sent to me, I try to verify that they work.  In cases
where this is not possible, I at least verify that they unpack OK on my
machine.  If neither is possible, I try to contact the author right
away.  For this reason, MAKE SURE to include a return address relative
to some well-known site(s).

Two things to note:  First, I often have to repack submissions so they
fit in small enough pieces.  Second, except in rare cases, source
without documentation and a Makefile will not be published.

I am always looking for suggestions on how to improve the usefulness
of mod.sources.  When all else fails, my conventional address and
phone number are:

Rich -

	Your /bin/sh example doesn't work on the Sun 3.0 /bin/sh,
which is derived from SysV Rel2.  Besides the obvious error (getopt
asking about flags "d:s" and then checking for -a and -b in the
body), there are a few other problems.  Here's the corrected version
for merging back into the man page (assuming it was globally wrong 
and that this isn't due to our shell):

#!/bin/sh
set -- `getopt "ab:" $@`
if test $? != 0 ; then
	echo "Read the documentation and try again."
	exit 1
fi
Aflag=0
Name=NONE
for f
do
	case "$f" in
		-a)	Aflag=1
			;;
		-b)	shift
			Name=$1
			;;
		--)	break
			;;
	esac
	shift
done
echo Aflag=$Aflag / Name=$Name / Remaining args are $*

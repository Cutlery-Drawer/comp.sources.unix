-.br
-.B expire
-.B \-u
-.SH DESCRIPTION
-.PP
-.I Expire
-is the program that removes out-of-date news articles from your system.
-You need to use a special program to do this, instead of just using
-.I find(1)
-or
-.I rm(1),
-because of the history file. If you just delete messages, then the history
-file will become incorrect because it will show that they are still there.
-.PP
-The normal use of
-.I expire
-is to run it at regular intervals with no options.
-It will remove all articles whose expiration date have passed.
-If you have a lot of disk space, you can run it once a week. If disk space is
-tight, you might want to run it every night. The time that it takes
-to run depends, of course, on many factors; on a VAX 11/750 with a 15-day
-expiration period and the volume of news that is typical in 1986 (about 5000
-articles per week),
-.I expire
-will take roughly an hour to run.
-.PP
-.I Expire
-has the following options:
-.TP
-.B \-n
-Specify certain newsgroups whose articles will be expired. The other
-newsgroups will be left alone. The notation that you use with the \-n option
-is quite similar to that used in the sys file. To expire only the articles in
-talk.origins, leaving everything else alone, type this:
-.nf
-	expire \-n talk.origins
-.fi
-To expire only the articles in comp.os, but leave comp.os.eunice and
-comp.os.cpm alone, type this:
-.nf
-	expire \-n comp.os !comp.os.eunice !comp.os.cpm
-.fi
-For compatibility with the syntax of the sys file, you can also type the
-command this way, with commas instead of spaces between the fields.
-.nf
-	expire \-n comp.os,!comp.os.eunice,!comp.os.cpm
-.fi
-If you have certain groups that you use as archives, which should never have
-their articles expired, you must construct an
-.I expire
-command that mentions all groups except your archive groups. When doing this,
-be sure not to forget the groups
-.Ch junk ,
-.Ch control ,
-and
-.Ch general .
-A likely command would be:
-.nf
-	expire \-n all,!local.source,!all.sources
-.fi
-.TP
-.B \-e
-Specify an expiration period. Normally
-.I expire
-removes articles that are older than 15 days. If you would like it to remove
-articles that are older than 5 days, you can type
-.nf
-	expire \-e 5
-.fi
-If you would like it to remove articles from talk.religion.misc and
-talk.politics.misc that are older than
-23 days, and leave everything else alone, you can type
-.nf
-	expire \-e 23 \-n talk.religion.misc talk.politics.misc
-.fi
-You can specify the \-e option as \-e15 instead of as \-e\ 15 if you want;
-this is for compatibility with old versions and old habits.
-.TP
-\-E
-Normally
-.I expire
-removes the record of an article from the history file at the same time it
-removes the article. One of the purposes of the history file is to prevent
-articles from being duplicated if a second copy arrives a while later,
-perhaps over some other path. If your site is extremely short on disk space,
-forcing you to specify a short expiration period in the \-e option, you can
-use the \-E option to ask that the information in the history file be kept
-round a bit longer, until the danger of duplicate arrival has passed. The
-command
-.nf
-	expire \-e 7 \-E 21
-.fi
-Causes articles that are 7 or more days old to be removed, and history
-information that is 21 or more days old to be removed. If you use the \-E
-option, make sure that the value it specifies is always larger than the \-e
-option value, else you will end up with articles that are not in the history
-file; this can cause problems.
-.TP
-.B \-a
-Asks that articles be archived (usually in /usr/spool/oldnews) instead of being deleted.
-An example of its use would be
-.nf
-	expire \-a all.sources,!comp.sources.bugs
-.fi
-.B \-a 
-may be used with 
-.BR \-n .
-If no pattern is given for 
-.BR \-a ,
-all newsgroups specified by 
-.B \-n
-will be archived.
-.TP
-.B \-I
-instructs
-.I expire
-to ignore expiration dates stored in articles, and to look at the number of
-days that have passed since the article was received. Not very many articles
-have expiration dates in them.
-.TP
-.B \-i
-is like \-I, but it will look at the number of days that have passed and also
-at the explicit expiration date, and it will remove the article if either of
-those has passed.
-.TP
-\-v
-sets the verbosity mode. If you have specified a complex collection of
-options and they are not having the effect that you would like, then set \-v2
-or \-v3 to find out what is going on. Values from 0 to 6 are meaningful, and
-\-v1 is the default. \-v0 will turn off messages, and \-v6 will cause
-.I expire
-to print every possible message.
-.TP
-\-p
-causes
-.I expire
-to use the date the article was posted, rather than the date it arrived at
-your machine, as the basis for expiration. Every now and then there is a
-.Ch "time warp"
-that causes a batch of very very old news to be dumped onto the
-network; judicious use of the \-p option can eradicate it.
-.TP
-\-f
-asks
-.I expire
-to remove messages sent by a particular user, regardless of the newsgroup
-that they are in, and regardless of how old they are.
-This option is intended not so much to selectively censor
-voluminous posters (though it has certainly been used for that) but to
-recover when a
-.I notesfiles
-site (running different news software) accidentally releases a duplicate
-batch of old news. An example of its use is
-.nf
-	expire \-f rlr@pyuxd.UUCP
-.fi
-Any article whose From: field exactly matches the argument to the \-f option
-will be removed.
-.TP
-\-h
-causes
-.I expire
-to ignore the history file, and do its expiration by looking at every article
-file in the spool directory. This is phenomenally slow\(emit can take 5 or 6
-hours on an otherwise idle VAX 11/750\(embut if your history file is damaged and
-you cannot use
-.I find(1)
-because you are relying on expiration dates stored inside articles, then you
-have no other choice.
-.TP
-\-r
-causes
-.I expire
-to rebuild the history file in addition to doing expiration.  The \-r option
-implies the \-h option; it scans every article in the spool directory and
-builds a new set of history and
-.I dbm(3X)
-files. It also performs expiration, so if you want to rebuild the history
-file while preserving all articles (as you might want to do on an archival
-file computer), you must specify
-.nf
-	expire \-r \-I \-e 999999 \-E 999999
-.fi
-to prevent expiration from taking place.
-If you do not rely on expiration dates stored inside articles, it is a good
-tonic to run the following sequence of commands once every now and then:
-.nf
-	find /usr/spool/news \-size 0 \-o \-mtime +90 \-exec rm \-f {} \;
-	/usr/lib/news/expire \-r
-.fi
-This will remove junk files that have somehow managed to find their way into
-the spooling directory, and then it will rebuild the history file.
-.TP
-\-u
-causes the minimum article-number field in the active file to be updated.
-This is used when converting from 2.10.1 news to later versions.

-.TH GETDATE 3 "May 26, 1986"
-.ds ]W  Version B 2.11
-.SH NAME
-getdate \- convert time and date from \s-2ASCII\s0
-.SH SYNOPSIS
-.B #include <sys/types.h>
-.br
-.B #include <sys/timeb.h>
-.PP
-.B time_t getdate(buf, now)
-.br
-.B char *buf;
-.br
-struct timeb *now;
-.SH DESCRIPTION
-.I Getdate
-is a routine that converts most common time specifications to standard UNIX
-format.  The first argument is the character string containing the
-time and date; the second is the assumed current time (used for relative
-specifications); if
-.B NULL
-is passed,
-.IR ftime (3C)
-is used to obtain the current time and timezone.
-.PP
-The character string consists of 0 or more specifications of the following
-form:
-.TP .75i
-tod
-A
-.I tod
-is a time of day, which is of the form
-.IR hh [: mm [: ss ]]
-(or
-.IR hhmm )
-.RI [ meridian ]
-.RI [ zone ].
-If no meridian \-
-.B am
-or
-.B pm
-\- is specified, a 24-hour clock is used.  A
-.I tod
-may be specified as just
-.I hh
-followed by a
-.IR meridian \&.
-.TP .75i
-date
-A
-.I date
-is a specific month and day, and possibly a year.  Acceptable formats are
-.IR mm/dd [ /yy ]
-and
-.IR "monthname dd" "[, " yy ]
-If omitted, the year defaults to the
-current year; if a year is specified
-as a number less than 100, 1900 is added.
-If a number not followed by a day or relative time unit occurs, it will
-be interpreted as a year if a
-.IR tod ,
-.IR monthname ,
-and
-.I dd
-have already been specified; otherwise, it will be treated as a
-.IR tod .
-This rule allows the output from
-.IR date (1)
-or
-.IR ctime (3)
-to be passed as input to
-.IR getdate .
-.TP .75i
-day
-A
-.I day
-of the week may be specified; the current day will be used if appropriate.
-A
-.I day
-may be preceded by a
-.IR number,
-indicating which instance of that day is desired; the default is
-.BR 1 .
-Negative
-.I numbers
-indicate times past.  Some symbolic
-.I numbers
-are accepted:
-.BR last ,
-.BR next ,
-and the ordinals
-.B first
-through
-.B twelfth
-.RB ( second
-is ambiguous, and is not accepted as an ordinal number).
-The symbolic number
-.B next
-is equivalent to
-.BR 2 ;
-thus,
-.B "next monday"
-refers not to the immediately coming Monday, but to the one a week later.
-.TP .75i
-relative time
-Specifications relative to the current time are also accepted.  
-The format is
-.RI [ number "] " unit ;
-acceptable units are
-.BR year ,
-.BR month ,
-.BR fortnight ,
-.BR week ,
-.BR day ,
-.BR hour ,
-.BR minute ,
-and
-.BR second .
-.PP
-The actual date is formed as follows:  first, any absolute date and/or time
-is processed and converted.  Using that time as the base, day-of-week
-specifications are added; last, relative specifications are used.  If a
-date or day is specified, and no absolute or relative time is given, midnight
-is used.
-Finally, a correction is applied so that the correct hour of the day is
-produced after allowing for daylight savings time differences.
-.PP
-.I Getdate
-accepts most common abbreviations for days, months, etc.; in particular,
-it will recognize them with upper or lower case first letter, and will
-recognize three-letter abbreviations for any of them, with or without
-a trailing period.  Units, such as
-.BR week s,
-may be specified in the singular or plural.  Timezone and meridian
-values may be in upper or lower case, and with or without periods.

-.SH BUGS
-Because
-.IR yacc (1)
-is used to parse the date,
-.I getdate
-cannot be used a subroutine to any program that also needs
-.IR yacc .
-.br
-The grammar and scanner are rather primitive; certain desirable and
-unambiguous constructions are not accepted.  Worse yet, the meaning of
-some legal phrases is not what is expected;
-.B next week
-is identical to
-.BR "2 weeks" .
-.br
-The daylight savings time correction is not perfect, and can get confused
-if handed times between midnight and 2:00 am on the days that the
-reckoning changes.
-.br
-Because
-.IR localtime (2)
-accepts an old-style time format without zone information, attempting
-to pass
-.I getdate
-a current time containing a different zone will probably fail.

-.SH DESCRIPTION
-.I Inews
-submits news articles to the USENET news network.
-It is a raw interface called by news-posting programs.
-You should not use
-.I inews
-directly. Most people use
-.IR postnews (1)
-to post news articles. Ultimately, of course,
-.IR postnews (1)
-and other news-posting programs call inews to do the actual submission.
-.PP
-The first form (no
-.BI \-p
-or
-.BI \-C
-options) is for submitting ordinary articles.
-The body of the article will be read from the standard input.  A
-.I title
-(
-.Ch Subject:
-field)
-must be specified (there is no default).
-.PP
-If
-.IR expire (8)
-is currently running or if 
-.B SPOOLBATCH
-was specified at compilation time, the articles may be spooled to
-.I /usr/spool/news/.rnews
-for later processing. Running 
-.I "rnews \-U"
-will unspool this articles.
-.I "Rnews \-U"
-is run automatically by expire when it is finished.
-.PP
-Each article is posted to one or more newsgroups. If the
-.B \-n
-flag is omitted, the list
-will default to something like
-.BR general .
-If you wish to submit an article to multiple newsgroups, the
-.I newsgroups
-must be separated by commas and/or spaces.
-.PP
-The
-.B \-e
-flag is used to override the default expiration date. This is seldom
-used.
-.PP
-The
-.B \-f
-flag specifies the article's sender.  Without this flag, the sender
-defaults to the user's name.
-If
-.B \-f
-is specified, the real sender's name will be included as a ``Sender:'' line
-to prevent forged articles.
-.PP
-The
-.B \-d
-flag allows you to specify the maximum geographic distribution of your
-article; for example, a distribution of
-.Ch aus
-limits distribution to Australia, and a distribution of
-.Ch nj
-limits distribution to New Jersey. There is no way to send a message from
-California for distribution only in New Jersey\(emyour machine must be in the
-distribution that you ask for.
-.PP
-The
-.B \-r
-flag allows you to specify the ``Reply-To:'' line in the article header.
-.PP
-The
-.B \-x
-flag says not to forward this article to the specified site despite
-what the
-.I /usr/lib/news/sys
-file says.
-.PP
-The
-.B \-F
-flag is used to attach a list of related articles that this
-message references; it creates the
-.Ch References:
-field of the posted article.
-.PP
-The
-.B \-o
-is used to override the default organization name.
-.PP
-The
-.B \-M
-and
-.B \-a
-flags are to be used only by the moderator of a moderated newsgroup. The
-.B \-M
-flag causes the
-.Ch From:
-and
-.Ch Path:
-fields of the article to be set to correct values for a moderated newsgroup.
-The
-.B \-a
-flag is used to add an
-.Ch Approved:
-line to the header. Note that if the
-.B \-M
-flag is used in conjuction with the
-.B \-h
-flag (see below), the article headers must not have a
-.Ch Path:
-field in them already.
-.PP
-The
-.B \-h
-flag specifies that headers are present at the beginning of the
-article, and these headers should be included with the article
-header instead of as text. Everything before the first blank line in the
-article is taken as a header field, and everything after that blank line is
-taken to be part of the body of the message.
-(This mechanism can be used to edit headers and supply additional
-nondefault headers, but not to specify certain information,
-such as the sender and article ID, that
-.I inews
-itself generates.)
-.I Inews
-will ignore nonstandard and misspelled header fields entered with the \-h
-option.
-.PP
-The
-.I \-c
-flag is used to send a control message.
-.PP
-The
-.I \-S
-flag is used to override the automatic spooling option (if enabled).
-It shold never be specified directly.  (It is normally used by
-.IR "rnews \-U" .
-.LP
-When posting an article
-.I inews
-checks the environment for certain information about the sender. If
-an environment variable
-.B NAME
-is defined,
-.I inews
-uses its value as the full name of the poster. If
-.B NAME
-is not defined,
-\kx\f2$HOME\fP\h'|\nxu+2u'\f2$HOME/.name\fP
-is checked and if it exists, its contents are used as the full name.
-Otherwise, the system value (often in
-.IR /etc/passwd )
-is used.
-This is useful if the system value cannot be set, or when
-more than one person uses the same login.
-If the environment variable
-.B ORGANIZATION
-is defined, then
-.I inews
-uses its value instead of the system
-default organization name. If its value begins with a
-.Ch / ,
-then it is taken to be a file name, and
-.I inews
-takes the name of the organization from the contents of the file.
-This is useful when a person uses a guest login and is
-not primarily associated with the organization that owns the machine.
-.LP
-The second form (
-.BI "inews \-p"
-) is used for receiving articles from other machines. If
-.I filename
-is given, the article will be read from the file of that name; otherwise
-the article will be read from the standard input.  An expiration date
-need not be present and a reception date, if present, will be ignored.
-.LP
-When
-.I inews
-receives an article this way, it will check the history file to make sure
-that the article is not already present, and it will make certain consistency
-checks to make sure that the newsgroup names are legal and that the sys file
-permits the article to be installed on the local machine. Once the article
-passes those checks, it is installed in the appropriate directory on the
-local machine. If the article fails those checks, it is installed in
-newsgroup

-format is the only format that version 1 netnews systems can read or write.
-Systems running the version 2 netnews can read either format and there
-are provisions for the version 2 netnews to write in
-.BR A " format.  " A " format"
-looks like this:
-.LP
-.BI A article-ID

-.br
-.I Body of article
-.br
-.LP
-Only version 2 netnews systems can read and write
-.BR B " format.  " B " format"
-contains two extra pieces of information:  receipt date and expiration
-date.  The basic structure of a
-.B B
-format file consists of a series of headers and then the body.  A header
-field is defined as a line with a capital letter in the first column and
-a colon somewhere on the line.  Unrecognized header fields are ignored.

-.TH NEWSRC 5 "October 19, 1986"
-.ds ]W  Version B 2.11
-.SH NAME
-newsrc \- information file for readnews(1) and checknews(1)
-.SH DESCRIPTION
-The
-.I .newsrc
-file contains the list of previously read articles and an optional
-options line for
-.IR readnews "(1) and " checknews (1).
-Each newsgroup that articles
-have been read from has a line of the form:
-.LP
-.IB newsgroup : " range"
-.LP
-The
-.I range
-is a list of the articles read.  It is basically a list of numbers
-separated by commas with sequential numbers collapsed with hyphens.
-For instance:
-.LP
-.B general: 1-78,80,85-90
-.br
-.B comp.laser-printers: 1-7
-.br
-.B news.misc: 1
-.br
-.B comp.ai! 1-5
-.br
-.LP
-If the
-.Ch :
-is replaced with an
-.Ch !
-(as in
-.B comp.ai
-above) the newsgroup
-is not subscribed to and will not be shown to the user.
-.LP
-An options line starts with the word
-.B options
-(left-justified).  Then there are the list of options just as they
-would be on the 
-.I readnews
-command line.  For instance:
-.LP
-.B "options \-n all !net.sf-lovers !mod.human-nets \-r"
-.br
-.B "options \-c \-r"
-.LP
-A string of lines beginning with a space or tab after the initial options
-line will be considered continuation lines.

-.TH POSTNEWS 1 "October 22, 1986"
-.ds ]W  Version B 2.11
-.SH NAME
-postnews \- submit news articles
-.SH SYNOPSIS
-.BR postnews " [ "
-.IR article " ]"
-.SH DESCRIPTION
-.I Postnews
-is a program that calls
-.IR inews (8)
-to submit news articles to USENET.
-The commands should be self-explanatory, however you may type
-.Ch ?
-to most prompts to get a list of the possible options (except
-for the \*(LqKeywords\*(Rq of the article, etc).
-It will prompt the user for the title of the article
-(which should be a phrase suggesting the subject,
-so that persons reading the news can tell if they
-are interested in the article), for the newsgroup,
-and for the distribution.
-.PP
-The distribution is typically a geographic region or corporate region.
-Typing
-.Ch ?
-will get you a list of the possible distributions. You should
-use the minimum distribution that will serve your purpose for
-posting the article. For example, if you are selling your car in New
-Jersey, it is doubtful that someone in California (or Europe) would
-be willing to buy it. If you don't restrict the distribution to your
-local area, you will cause this article to be transmitted unnecessarily
-around the world.  Currently, with a distribution of
-.BR world ,
-the article
-will be seen in the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan, Korea and
-other places.
-A distribution header will, if given, be included in the headers
-of the article, affecting where the article is distributed.
-.PP
-After entering the title, newsgroup, and distribution,
-the user will be placed in an editor.
-If
-.B EDITOR
-is set in the environment, that editor will be used.
-Otherwise,
-.I postnews
-defaults to
-.IR vi (1).
-.PP
-An initial set of headers containing the subject and newsgroups
-will be placed in the editor, followed by a blank line.
-The article should be appended to the buffer, after the blank line.
-The initial headers can be changed, or additional headers added,
-while in the editor, if desired.
-.PP
-After you have finished typing in your article, you have the
-option of sending it, listing it, quitting without sending it,
-editing the file again, or
-saving it in a file without sending it.
-.PP
-For posting news from a program, see
-.IR inews (8).
-.LP
-If the file
-.I /usr/lib/news/recording
-is present, it is taken as a list of
-\&\*(Lqrecordings\*(Rq to be shown to users posting news.
-(This is named after the recording you hear when you dial
-.Ch information
-in some parts of the U.S., asking you to stop and think if you really want do
-do this, but not actually preventing you.)
-The recording file contains lines of the form:
-.PP
-	newsgroup-specifier \fB\s-2TAB\s0\fP filename
-.PP
-for example:
-.PP
-	comp.all	comp.recording
-.br
-	local.all,!local.test local.recording
-.PP
-Any user posting an article to a newsgroup matching the pattern on
-the left will be shown the contents of the file on the right.
-The file is found in the
-.B LIBDIR
-directory (often
-.IR /usr/lib/news ).
-The user is then told to hit \s-2DEL\s0 to abort or \s-2RETURN\s0 to proceed.
-The intent of this feature is to help companies keep proprietary
-information from accidently leaking out.

-.TP 10
-.B \-M
-An interface to
-.IR mailx (1)
-or
-.IR Mail(1).
-.TP 10
-.B \-c
-A
-.IR binmail (1)\-like
-interface.
-.TP 10
-.BI "\-c " ``mailer''
-All selected articles written to a temporary file.  Then the mailer is
-invoked.  The name of the temporary file is referenced with a
-.Ch % .
-Thus, ``mail \-f %'' will invoke mail on a temporary file consisting of all
-selected messages.
-.TP 10
-.B \-p
-All selected articles are sent to the standard output.  No questions asked.
-.TP 10
-.B \-l
-Only the titles output.  The
-.I .newsrc
-file will not be updated.
-.TP 10
-.B \-e
-Like
-.B \-l
-but also updates the
-.I .newsrc
-file.
-.LP
-The
-.B \-r
-flag causes the articles to be printed in reverse order.  The
-.B \-f
-flag prevents any followup articles from being printed.  The
-.B \-h
-flag causes articles to be printed in a less verbose format,
-and is intended for terminals running at 300 baud.
-The
-.B \-u
-flag causes the
-.I .newsrc
-file to be updated every 5 minutes,
-in case of an unreliable system.
-(Note that if the
-.I .newsrc
-file is updated,
-the
-.B x
-command will not restore it to its original contents.)
-.PP
-The following flags determine the selection of articles.
-.TP 10
-.BI "\-n " newsgroups
-Select all articles that belong to
-.I newsgroups.
-.TP 10
-.BI "\-t " titles
-Select all articles whose titles contain one of the strings specified by

-(in
-.IR getdate (3)
-format).
-.TP 10
-.B \-x
-Ignore
-.I .newsrc
-file.  That is, select articles that have already been read as well as new ones.
-.PP
-.I Readnews
-maintains a
-.I .newsrc
-file in the user's home directory that specifies all news articles
-already read.  It is updated at the end of each reading session in
-which the
-.BR \-x " or " \-l
-options weren't specified.
-If the environment variable
-.B NEWSRC
-is present, it should be the path
-name of a file to be used in place of
-.IR .newsrc \&.
-.PP
-If the user wishes, an options line may be placed in the
-.I .newsrc
-file.
-This line starts with the word
-.B options
-(left justified) followed by the list of standard options just as
-they would be typed on the command line.  Such a list may include:
-the
-.B \-n
-flag along with a newsgroup list; a favorite interface; and/or
-the
-.B \-r
-or
-.B \-t
-flag.  Continuation lines are specified by following lines
-beginning with a space or tab character.
-Similarly, options can be specified in the
-.B NEWSOPTS
-environment parameter.  Where conflicts exist, option on the command
-line take precedence, followed by the
-.I .newsrc
-.B options
-line, and lastly the
-.B NEWSOPTS
-parameter.
-.PP
-You can use the
-.B \-s
-flag to print the newsgroup subscription list.
-.PP
-If you haven't read news in a while (or if you have never read news!)
-you can do
-.I "readnews \-K"
-to Kill (mark as read) all of the articles in the groups to which
-you are subscribed.
-.PP
-When the user uses the reply command of the default or
-.IR binmail (1)
-interfaces, the environment parameter
-.B MAILER
-will be used to determine
-which mailer to use.  The default is
-.IR mail (1).
-.PP
-The user may specify a particular paging progam
-for articles.  The environment parameter
-.B PAGER
-should be set to
-the paging program.  The name of the article is referenced with
-a
-.Ch % ,
-as in the
-.B \-c
-option.  If no
-.Ch %
-is present, the article will be piped to the program.
-Paging may be disabled by setting
-.B PAGER
-to a null value.  By default, the pager is
-.IR cat (1).
-.SH "COMMANDS"
-.PP
-This section lists the commands you can type to the default and
-.I binmail
-interface prompts.
-The default interface will suggest some common commands in brackets.
-Just hitting return is the same as typing the first command.

-.BI \-i " sitename"
-] [
-.BR \-c " ] ["
-.BR \-c7 " ] ["
-.I \-obBC 
-.RI "] " site
-.SH DESCRIPTION
-.I sendbatch
-prepares and transmits a batch of news for unbatching by another machine.
-.PP
-If
-.I sendbatch
-is called with no flags, it will submit the batched news (from
-.IR /usr/spool/news/site )
-queued up for 
-.B site
-to 
-.I uux
-for transmission and exectution on the remote machine.
-.PP
-Several flags are available to modify sendbatch's behavior.
-.PP
-The
-.B \-c
-flag says to use compression to reduce the site of the transmitted file.
-.PP
-The
-.B \-c7
-flag is normally used for sending articles over X.25 links.
-It will cause the batch of news to be compressed, then piped through
-.I encode
-to reduce the 8-bit data into 7-bit characters.
-.PP
-The
-.B \-s
-flag is used to modify the size of the batches. By default, the
-batch size is 50,000 bytes.
-.PP
-The 
-.B \-i
-flag says to send a batch of Message-IDs with the 
-.I ihave
-protocol.
-.PP
-The
-.B \-o
-flag is used with the 
-.B \-c
-flag to produce and old style compress batch suitable for systems
-with version 2.10.2 news.
-.PP
-The
-.B \-bBC
-flags are passed directly to compress and may be used to change
-its compression algorithms if necessary.
-.SH EXAMPLES
-.PP
-To send to a PDP 11/70 running 2.10.2 compressed batching:
-.ti 1i
-sendbatch  \-c \-C \-b12 -o sitename
-.PP
-To send to a VAX running 2.11 compressed batching:
-.ti 1i
-sendbatch \-c sitename
-.PP
-To send to a VAX over an X.25 network using batches of 30,000 bytes:
-.ti 1i
-sendbatch \-c7 \-s30000 sitename
-.PP
-To send to a Sun running 2.11 compressed batching with 
-.I ihave/sendme
-:
-.ti 1i
-sendbatch \-c \-i sitename

-.SH SYNOPSIS
-.BR vnews " [ " \-a
-.IR date " ] [ "
-.B \-n
-.IR newsgroups " ] [ "
-.B \-t
-.IR titles " ] [ "
-.BR \-rxuc " ] "
-.PP
-.B "vnews \-s"
-.PP
-.B "vnews \-K"
-.SH DESCRIPTION
-.I Vnews 
-is a program for reading USENET news. It is based
-on
-.IR readnews (1)
-but has a CRT oriented interface.
-The list of available commands is quite
-similar, although since
-.I vnews
-is a \*(Lqvisual\*(Rq
-interface, most
-.I vnews
-commands do not have to be terminated
-by a newline.
-.LP
-.I Vnews
-uses all but the last two lines of the screen to display
-the current article. The next-to-last line is the secondary prompt line,
-and is used to input string arguments to commands.  The last line
-contains several fields.  The first field is the prompt
-field. If
-.I vnews
-is at the end of an article, the prompt is
-\&\*(Lqnext?\*(Rq; otherwise the prompt is \*(Lqmore?\*(Rq. The second field
-is the newsgroup field, which displays the current newsgroup,
-the number of the current article, and the number of
-the last article in the newsgroup. The third field contains
-the current time, and the last field contains the word
-\&\*(Lqmail\*(Rq if you have mail. When you receive new mail, the bell
-on the terminal is rung and the word \*(LqMAIL\*(Rq appears in capital
-letters for 30 seconds.
-.PP
-.I Vnews 
-without any arguments prints unread articles.
-.PP
-The following flags determine the selection of articles.
-.TP 10
-.BI "\-a " "\fR[\fP date \fR]\fP"
-Select articles posted after the given
-.I date
-(in
-.IR getdate (3)
-format).
-.TP 10
-.BI "\-n " newsgroups
-Select articles belonging to
-.I newsgroups.
-.TP 10
-.BI "\-t " titles
-Select articles whose titles contain one of the strings specified by
-.I titles.
-.TP 10
-.B \-r
-Print the articles in reverse order.
-.TP 10
-.B \-x
-Ignore
-.I .newsrc
-file.  That is, select articles that have already been read as well as new ones.
-.TP 10
-.B \-u
-Update the 
-.I .newsrc
-file every 5 minutes, as in the case of an unreliable system.
-(Note that if the
-.I .newsrc
-file is updated, the
-.B x
-command will not restore it to its original contents.)
-.PP
-If the
-.B \-c
-flag is specified,
-.I vnews
-will print the first
-page of the article, instead of just the header.
-.PP
-You can use the
-.B \-s
-flag to print the newsgroup subscription list.
-.PP
-If you haven't read news in a while (or if you have never read news!)
-you can do
-.I "vnews \-K"
-to Kill (mark as read) all of the articles in the groups to which
-you are subscribed.
-.PP
-.I Vnews
-maintains a
-.I .newsrc
-file in the your home directory that specifies all news articles
-already read.  It is updated at the end of each reading session
-unless the
-.BR \-x
-option was specified.
-If the environment variable
-.B NEWSRC
-is present, it should be the path
-name of a file to be used in place of
-.IR .newsrc \&.
-.PP
-If you wish, an options line may be placed in your
-.I .newsrc
-file.
-This line starts with the word
-.B options
-(left justified) followed by the list of standard options just as
-they would be typed on the command line.  Such a list may include:
-the
-.B \-n
-flag along with a newsgroup list and/or
-the
-.B \-r
-or
-.B \-t
-flag.  
-Continuation lines begin with a space or tab character.
-.SH ENVIRONMENT
-Options can be specified in the
-.B NEWSOPTS
-environment parameter.  Where conflicts exist, options on the command
-line take precedence, followed by the
-.I .newsrc
-.B options
-line, and lastly the
-.B NEWSOPTS
-parameter.
-.PP
-When the user uses the direct reply command,
-the environment parameter
-.B MAILER
-will be used to determine which mailer to use. The default is usually
-.IR /bin/mail .
-.PP
-If
-.B EDITOR
-is set, it will be used in place of the default editor on your system to
-edit replies and follow-ups.
-.PP
-If
-.B NAME
-is set, it will be used as your full name when posting news or
-submitting a follow-up. If it is not set, the name will be taken
-from the file
-.I .name
-in your home directory. If this file is not present, the name will
-be taken from
-.IR /etc/passwd .
-.PP
-If
-.B NEWSARCHIVE
-is set, a copy of any articles you post or follow-up to, will be saved
-in the specified file. If it is the null string, they will be
-copied in 
-.I author_copy
-in your home directory.
-.PP
-If
-.B NEWSBOX
-is set, the filename you specify when you save or write a file
-will be prepended with
-.B NEWSBOX
-unless the filename is an absolute pathname.
-.PP
-If
-.B NEWSRC
-is set, it will be used in place of the
-.I .newsrc
-file in your home directory.
-.PP
-If
-.B ORGANIZATION
-is set, it will be used as the name of your organization whenever you
-post an article. The default is compiled in and is usually correct.
-Typically, you would only use this if you were reading news at a
-site other than normal. (Or if you are trying to be cute.)
-.SH "COMMANDS"
-.PP
-Each
-.I vnews
-command may be preceded by a count.  Some
-commands use the count; others ignore it. If count is omitted,
-it defaults to one. Some commands prompt for an argument
-on the second line from the bottom of the screen.  Standard UNIX erase
-and kill processing is done on this argument.  The argument is
-terminated by a return. An interrupt
-(\s-2DEL\s0 or \s-2BREAK\s0) gets you out of any partially entered command. 
-.sp
-In the following table, ^B is used as a shorthand for Control-B.
-.sp
-.ta 2.5i
-Command		Meaning
-.IP \fB\s-2CR\s0\fP

Subject:  v07INF1:  Mod.Sources Index and Archives
Newsgroups: mod.sources
Approved: rs@mirror.UUCP

Mod.sources: Volume 7, Info 1
Archive-name: index.1

Since the last INFO posting, I have decided to remove the archive name
from the Subject lines.  Starting with this volume, each volume will
have only 100 issues in it.  An INFO posting at the mid-point of each
volume will contain the listing of articles published in that volume
to date.  Each new volume will start with a complete listing of the
old articles.  Because the start of a volume is totally dependant on
the (err) volume of submissions, I will not be putting an expiration
date on index listings.

I am always looking for suggestions on how to improve the usefulness
of mod.sources, and can be contacted as listed below.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	       SUBMITTING SOURCE FOR PUBLICATION

Items intended for posting should be sent to mirror!sources; requests
for missing copies or other queries should be sent to
mirror!sources-request.  In Australia, Robert Elz is a "sub-moderator";
people there can work with him (kre@munnari.OZ) to get postings out
more easily.

The backlog is running about seven days.  If you want verification
of arrival, so say in a cover note, or at the beginning of your submission,
if it is small.  I try to verify that a program works, and if I can't
get it to work, I may hold up posting it for a couple of days.  Please
note that, except in rare cases, source without documentation and a
Makefile will not be published.

When you send mail, MAKE SURE to include a return address relative to
some well-known site(s).  When all else fails, my conventional address
and phone number are:
	Rich $alz
	Mirror Systems
	2067 Massachusetts Avenue
	Cambridge, MA  02140
	617-661-0777

		    ACCESSING THE MOD.SOURCES ARCHIVE

The complete mod.sources archives are fairly large:
	Volume	  Size (Kbytes)
	  1	      4118
	  2	      1220
	  3	      3459
	  4	      4692
	  5	       406
	  6	      4359
There are several active archive sites around the net.  I am particularly
interested in helping set up a BITNET archive.  Due to delays on my part,
the European archive is not well set-up yet; look for an announcement
shortly.

Promised work in canonicalizing the names of all back-issues has not
been done, and may never get done.  Therefore, when you request something
before Volume 6, please make sure to be as descriptive as possible.

Several sites below will send tapes through the mail.  For those sites,
send a 1/2" mag tape WITH RETURN POSTAGE and RETURN MAILER.  Tapes
without postage or mailer will not be returned.  No other methods (COD,
etc.) are available; please don't ask.

1.  Rick Adams (rick@seismo.CSS.GOV) provides archive access to those on the
    Internet.  Access is available directly via anonymous ftp (Outside of
    9am-7pm EST M-F.) The files are in a directory mod.sources, then a
    sub-directory Volume[1-6]. They are named as closely as possible to the
    names in the Index.  Files that have not been assigned a "short name"
    reside in the directory sources/mod temporarily.  Send tape, mailer,
    and postage to Rick at:
        Center for Seismic Studies
        1300 North 17th Street, Suite 1450
        Arlington, VA 22209-3871

2.  Internet sites may also retrieve archives from j.cc.purdue.edu via
    anonymous ftp (1800-0800 EST only, please).  The archive is in the
    directory mod.sources, subdivided into Volume1, etc.  Each
    directory will have a file named Index detailing its contents.
    Chances are that the archive size will grow beyond the available
    disk space; if it does, they will keep the most recent volume(s)
    in the ftp directory, while storing older volumes elsewhere.  A
    README file will be created in the directories of misplaced volumes
    with instructions on how to get at sources from those volumes.
    This is being managed by Rich Kulawiec (Wombat), pucc-j!rsk,
    rsk@asc.purdue.edu.  People having trouble may want to try FTP'ing
    to purdue-asc.arpa.

3.  The CSNET CIC has been doing a fair amount of work to bring their
    automated retrieval up-to-speed.  They now have a complete archive,
    and are making things available as they quickly as possible (they
    have special legal restrictions on what they can distribute, so
    everything may not be available).  Look in the latest issue of
    the CSNET Forum, or contact the CSNET CIC at cic@sh.cs.net.

4.  Pyramid Technology has an archive arranged topically, and in compressed
    tar files.  They are happy to take new UUCP connections.  They are also
    somewhat willing to make tapes for people to come by and pick up,
    provided you call WELL in advance and bring lunch money.  This is being
    managed by Claudia Dimmers and/or Carl Gutekunst.  Contact
    pyramid!usenet for more info.

5.  Robert Elz (kre@munnari.OZ) keeps mod.sources in different ways
    depending on his available disk space; contact him for more info.

6.  Ron Heiby has an archive on-line, and will soon have "anonymous UUCP"
    access; contact usenet@cuae2.ATT.COM for more info.

7.  Tom Patterson at Washington University can make 800/1600/6250 BPI
    tar tapes.  If you give him a "real good reason," he can also make
    1600 BPI VMS BACKUP or ANSI tapes.  Send your tape, mailer, and postage
    to Tom at:
	    Engineering Computer Lab, Bryan 509
	    Lindell & Skinker Blvd
	    Washington University
	    St. Louis, MO 63130
    For best results, first send mail to wucs!archive (you stand a better
    chance of getting processed quickly that way).

8.  Jim Thompson (otto!jim) can make 1600 and 6250 tar and cpio tapes,
    as well as VMS backup in a real pinch.  He will also provide a
    temporary UUCP login for interested parties (2400 baud expected soon).
    His postal address is:
	    Jim Thompson
	    2551 Green Valley Pkwy
	    Henderson, Nv. 89015
	    (702) 454-4636
9.  Of course, I have a complete set of archives.  I can mail individual
    postings, make files available for UUCP, and will send tapes (1600
    BPI tar; 6250 or cpio in a crunch).  Last time I checked, it cost
    about $5 to send a 2400' tape across the country in a padded envelope
    via first-class mail.

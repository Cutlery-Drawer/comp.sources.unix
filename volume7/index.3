Subject:  v07INF7:  Archive access and listing
Newsgroups: mod.sources
Approved: mirror!rs

Mod.sources: Volume 7, Info 7
Archive-name: index.3

This article contains a complete list of all Mod.Sources articles published
in the previous volumes, along with directions for how to request things
from the archives.  There are several active archive sites around the net,
including sites that provide anonymous FTP access for Internet sites, and
one that provides anonymous UUCP access for UUCP-only sites.  The European
archive is not well set-up yet; look for an announcement soon.

Please note that archive access is provided on a volunteer basis, and try to
avoid obnoxious request like "please mail me all the March 1985 sources."

The complete mod.sources archives are fairly large:
	Volume	  Size (Kbytes)
	  1	      4118
	  2	      1220
	  3	      3459
	  4	      4692
	  5	       406
	  6	      4359

When you request something before Volume 6, please make sure to be as
descriptive as possible.

Several people below will send tapes through the mail.  For those sites,
send a 1/2" mag tape WITH RETURN POSTAGE and RETURN MAILER.  Tapes
without postage or mailer will not be returned.  No other methods (COD,
etc.) are available; please don't ask.

1.   Ron Heiby has an archive on-line; contact usenet@cuae2.ATT.COM for more
     info.  He has also set up an off-hours UUCP login providing anonymous
     UUCP access to the archives.  The Systems file (L.sys) entry looks like:
     (for HoneyDanBer UUCP users)
	     cuaepd Wk1830-0530,Sa,Su ACU 1200 3129643773 in:--in: pduucp
     (for Old UUCP users)
	     cuaepd Any1830-0530 ACU 1200 3129643773 in:--in: pduucp
     Retrieve the file cuaepd!~/netnews/mod.sources/howto.snarf and follow the
     directions therein.

2.   Pyramid Technology has an archive arranged topically, and in compressed
     tar files.  They are happy to take new UUCP connections.  They are also
     somewhat willing to make tapes for people to come by and pick up,
     provided you call WELL in advance and bring lunch money.  This is being
     managed by Claudia Dimmers and/or Carl Gutekunst.  Contact
     pyramid!usenet for more info.

3.   Robert Elz (kre@munnari.OZ) keeps mod.sources in different ways
     depending on his available disk space; contact him for more info.

4.   Thos Sumner at UCSF will respond to requests for material, but cannot
     promise an ongoing commitment.  Anyone requesting material via mail
     should supply a path from ucbvax.  Anyone requesting tape should
     contact me first.  Contact him at thos@cca.ucsf.edu, or
     ucbvax!ucsfcgl!cca.UCSF!thos

5.   Tom Patterson at Washington University can make 800/1600/6250 BPI
     tar tapes.  If you give him a "real good reason," he can also make
     1600 BPI VMS BACKUP or ANSI tapes.  Send your tape, mailer, and postage
     to Tom at:
	     Engineering Computer Lab, Bryan 509
	     Lindell & Skinker Blvd
	     Washington University
	     St. Louis, MO 63130
     For best results, first send mail to wucs!archive (you stand a better
     chance of getting processed quickly that way).

6.   Jim Thompson (otto!jim) can make 1600 and 6250 tar and cpio tapes,
     as well as VMS backup in a real pinch.  He will also provide a
     temporary UUCP login for interested parties (2400 baud expected soon).
     His postal address is:
	     Jim Thompson
	     2551 Green Valley Pkwy
	     Henderson, Nv. 89015
	     (702) 454-4636

7.   Of course, I have a complete set of archives.  I can mail individual
     postings, make files available for UUCP, and will send tapes (1600
     BPI tar; 6250 or cpio in a crunch).  Last time I checked, it cost
     about $3 to send a 2400' tape across the country in a padded envelope
     via first-class mail.

8.   Rick Adams (rick@seismo.CSS.GOV) provides archive access to those on the
     Internet.  Access is available directly via anonymous FTP (Outside of
     9am-7pm EST M-F.) The files are in a directory mod.sources, then a
     sub-directory Volume[1-7]. They are named as closely as possible to the
     names in the Index.  Files that have not been assigned a "short name"
     reside in the directory sources/mod temporarily.  Send tape, mailer,
     and postage to Rick at:
	 Center for Seismic Studies
	 1300 North 17th Street, Suite 1450
	 Arlington, VA 22209-3871

9.   Internet sites may also retrieve archives from j.cc.purdue.edu via
     anonymous FTP (1800-0800 EST only, please).  The archive is in the
     directory mod.sources, subdivided into Volume1, etc.  Each
     directory will have a file named Index detailing its contents.
     Chances are that the archive size will grow beyond the available
     disk space; if it does, they will keep the most recent volume(s)
     in the FTP directory, while storing older volumes elsewhere.  A
     README file will be created in the directories of misplaced volumes
     with instructions on how to get at sources from those volumes.
     This is being managed by Rich Kulawiec (Wombat), pucc-j!rsk,
     rsk@asc.purdue.edu.  People having trouble may want to try FTP'ing
     to purdue-asc.arpa.

10.  The CSNET CIC has been doing a fair amount of work to bring their
     automated retrieval up-to-speed.  They now have a complete archive,
     and are making things available as quickly as possible (they have
     special legal restrictions on what they can distribute, so everything
     may not be available).  Look in the latest issue of the CSNET Forum,
     or contact postmaster@sh.cs.net.

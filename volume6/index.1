volume rather than date; any opinions?

		    SUBMITTING SOURCE FOR PUBLICATION

Items intended for posting should be sent to mirror!sources; requests
for reposts or other queries should be sent to mirror!sources-request.
In Australia, Robert Elz is a "sub-moderator"; people there can work
with him (munnari!elz) to get postings out more easily.

The backlog is running about five to seven days.  If you want verification
of arrival, so say in a cover note, or at the beginning of your submission,
if it is small.  I try to verify that a program works, and if I can't
get it to work, I may hold up posting it for a couple of days.  Please
note that, except in rare cases, source without documentation will not
be published.

When you send mail, MAKE SURE to include a return address relative to
some well-known site(s).  When all else fails, my conventional address
and phone number are:
	Rich $alz
	Mirror Systems
	2067 Massachusetts Avenue
	Cambridge, MA  02140
	617-661-0777

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
		    ACCESSING THE MOD.SOURCES ARCHIVE

The complete mod.sources archives are fairly large:
	Volume	  Size (Kbytes)
	  1	      4118
	  2	      1220
	  3	      3459
	  4	      4692
	  5	       406
	  6	      1338 (so far)
There are several active archive sites around the net.  I am particularly
interested in helping set up a European archive.

Over the next month or so I will be working with the archive sites to
"rationalize" the names of Volume 1-5 so that the same names are used
at all sites; the format of future index postings will reflect these
common names.  If you missed a posting, please contact your closest
archive site; reposts in mod.sources are unusual.

Several sites below will send tapes through the mail.  For those sites,
send a 1/2" mag tape WITH RETURN POSTAGE and RETURN MAILER.  Tapes
without postage or mailer will not be returned.  No other methods (COD,
etc.) are available; please don't ask.

1.  Rick Adams (rick@seismo.CSS.GOV) provides archive access to those on the
    ARPAnet.  Access is available directly via anonymous ftp (Outside of
    9am-7pm EST M-F.) The files are in a directory mod.sources, then a
    sub-directory Volume[1-4]. They are named as closely as possible to the
    names in the Index.  Files that have not been assigned a "short name"
    reside in the directory sources/mod temporarily.  Send tape, mailer,
    and postage to:
        Rick Adams
        Center for Seismic Studies
        1300 North 17th Street, Suite 1450
        Arlington, VA 22209-3871

2.  ARPA sites may also retrieve archives from j.cc.purdue.edu via
    anonymous ftp (1800-0800 EST only, please).  The archive is in the
    directory mod.sources, subdivided into Volume1, Volume2, etc.  Each
    directory will have a file named Index detailing its contents.
    Chances are that the archive size will grow beyond the available
    disk space; if it does, they will keep the most recent volume(s)
    in the ftp directory, while storing older volumes elsewhere.  A
    README file will be created in the directories of misplaced volumes
    with instructions on how to get at sources from those volumes.
    This is being managed by Rich Kulawiec (Wombat), pucc-j!rsk,
    rsk@asc.purdue.edu

3.  The CSNET CIC provides archive access to CSNET sites.  This access
    is automated.   You need simply mail a message in appropriate
    format to the CSNET Info Server (info@csnet-sh.arpa or
    info@sh.cs.net) to retrieve distributions.  For more details about
    this service, contact the CIC at cic@sh.cs.net.

4.  Pyramid Technology has an archive arranged topically, and in compressed
    tar files.  They are happy to take new UUCP connections.  They are also
    somewhat willing to make tapes for people to come by and pick up,
    provided you call WELL in advance and bring lunch money.  This is being
    managed by Claudia Dimmers and/or Carl Gutekunst.  Contact
    pyramid!usenet for more info.

5.  Robert Elz (munnari!elz) keeps mod.sources in compress and uncompressed
    form; contact him for more information.

6.  Ron Heiby has an archive on-line, and may be providing "anonymous UUCP"
    access; contact cuea2!usenet for more info.

7.  Tom Patterson at Washington University can make 800/1600/6250 BPI
    tar tapes.  If you give him a "real good reason," he can also make
    1600 BPI VMS BACKUP or ANSI tapes.  Send your tape, mailer, and postage
    to Tom at:
	    Engineering Computer Lab, Bryan 509
	    Lindell & Skinker Blvd
	    Washington University
	    St. Louis, MO 63130
    For best results, first send mail to wucs!archive (you stand a better
    chance of getting processed quickly that way).

8.  Of course, I have a complete set of archives.  I can mail individual
    postings, make files available for UUCP, and will send tapes (1600
    BPI tar; 6250 or cpio in a crunch).  Last time I checked, it cost
    about $5 to send a 2400' tape across the country in a padded envelope
    via first-class mail.  In a real crunch, I might be able to write
    files onto MS-DOS diskettes; send e-mail before sending floppies!

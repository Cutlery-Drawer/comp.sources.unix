Mod.sources: Volume 6, Issue 1
Archive-name: intro

This posting marks the start of Volume 6.  Starting with this posting,
mod.sources has a new moderator.  Thanks to John Nelson for the great
job he has done to date.

Sorry about the delay in gettings things switched over.  Mirror is a
notes site, so I had to familiarize myself with news, get feeds set
up, etc.  I have five postings backlogged right now, and will send
one or two of them out before Usenix.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
			SUBJECT LINES

There are now two types of postings in mod.sources:  sources, and information
postings (such as this one).  The subject lines will identify the type.
Sources will all start with the issue number (VxxIyyy).  If a program has
been split into parts, something like ", Part1/9" will appear after
the subject proper.  The "official" archive name will be in parentheses
as the last part of the subject text.

The first three lines of the message body will be header-style lines that
detail the issue number, original source of the posting, and the archive
name.

Information postings, indices and the like, will start with "INFOxxx:",
where xxx is a sequence number.  The intent is help distinguish the
meat from the fluff.

In summary, two samples:
	v06i002:  Log off idle users, squash multiple logins, etc. (untamo)
	INFO001:  Automated UUCP retrieval available

			CONTACTING THE MODERATOR

Mirror is moderately well-connected, and speaks to the following sites:
    cbosgd* cca* cuae2 ihnp4 inmet* mit-eddie* pyramid pyrnj* wjh12*
This is a rough list, and not all sites are polled; check the mod.map
data.  Sites marked with an asterisk receive mod.sources from us.  This
is a pretty good distribution, so propagation throughout the net should
be fairly quick.

We are also willing to connect to almost anyone; send mail to
mirror!postmaster for details.

Items intended for posting should be sent to mirror!sources; requests
for reposts or other queries should be sent to mirror!sources-request.
Postings are generally sent out within 24 hours.  If you want verification
of arrival, so say in a cover note, or at the beginning of your submission,
if it is small.  I try to verify that a programs works, and if I can't
get it to work, I may hold up posting it for a couple of days.

When you send mail, MAKE SURE to include a return address relative to
some well-known site(s).  When all else fails, my conventional address
and phone number are:
	Rich $alz
	Mirror Systems
	2067 Massachusetts Avenue
	Cambridge, MA  02140
	617-661-0777

                	ACCESSING THE MOD.SOURCES ARCHIVE

The complete mod.sources archives are fairly large:
	Volume	Size (Kbytes)
	  1	    4118
	  2	    1220
	  3	    3459
	  4	    4692
	  5	     406
There are several active archive sites around the net.  Unfortunately,
most sites follow different naming conventions.  (This is something I
hope to fix soon.)  If you missed a posting, please contact a site
listed here; reposts in mod.sources are unusual.

1.  Rick Adams (rick@seismo.CSS.GOV) provides archive access to those on the
    ARPAnet.  Access is available directly via anonymous ftp (Outside of
    9am-7pm EST M-F.) The files are in a directory mod.sources, then a
    sub-directory Volume[1-4]. They are named as closely as possible to the
    names in the Index.  Files that have not been assigned a "short name"
    reside in the directory sources/mod temporarily.  Tape access is also
    available. Send a 1/2" mag tape WITH RETURN POSTAGE and RETURN MAILING
    container to:
        Rick Adams
        Center for Seismic Studies
        1300 North 17th Street, Suite 1450
        Arlington, VA 22209-3871
    Tapes without return postage or mailer will NOT be returned.
    No other methods (including COD, etc) are available. Please don't ask.

2.  ARPA sites may also retrieve archives from j.cc.purdue.edu via
    anonymous ftp (1800-0800 EST only, please).  The archive is in the
    directory mod.sources, subdivided into Volume1, Volume2, etc.  Each
    directory will have a file named Index detailing its contents.
    Chances are that the archive size will grow beyond the available
    disk space; if it does, they will keep the most recent volume(s)
    in the ftp directory, while storing older volumes elsewhere.  A
    README file will be created in the directories of misplaced volumes
    with instructions on how to get at sources from those volumes.
    This is being managed by Rich Kulawiec (Wombat), pucc-j!rsk,
    rsk@asc.purdue.edu

3.  The CSNET CIC provides archive access to CSNET sites.  This access
    is automated.   You need simply mail a message in appropriate format
    to the CSNET Info Server (info@csnet-sh.arpa or info@sh.cs.net) to retrieve
    distributions.  For more details about this service, contact the
    CIC at cic@sh.cs.net.

4.  Pyramid Technology has an archive arranged topically, and in compressed
    tar files.  They are happy to take new UUCP connections.  They are also
    somewhat willing to make tapes for people to come by and pick up,
    provided you call WELL in advance and bring lunch money.  This is being
    managed by Claudia Dimmers and/or Carl Gutekunst.  Contact
    pyramid!usenet for more info.

5.  James Turner (imagen!turner) will be providing automated retrieval
    via UUCP mail.  I will post an announcement when he is ready --
    don't bother him with mail.

6.  Of course, I have a complete set of archives.  I can mail individual
    postings, make files available for UUCP, and will send tapes.  If you
    send me a tape, make sure to include return postage and a mailer.
    I will only send tapes at 1600bpi tar-format, although 6250 may be
    available some time later.  Last time I checked, it cost about $5
    to send a 2400' tape across the country in a padded envelope via
    first-class mail.

If anyone else wants to become an archive site, please let me know.
I can provide a tape of the official archive directory to help you
get started.

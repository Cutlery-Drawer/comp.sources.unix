I've been thinking for a long while that the format used by the
comp.sources.unix archives is not as useful as it could be.  What
we do is create a directory for each volume, and under that we 
create a directory by the name of the package (perhaps qualified
by its version number), and under that we place files like "part01"
and "patch01", which are eventually compressed with "gzip."

My first take on how to make it better was to
change
	volumeNN/PKG-VER/{part,patch}XX
to
	PKG/VER/{part,patch}XX
since I
have observed that most people don't care about the volume numbers
once they're at the point of searching the archives.

I have decided that this would be good as far as it goes, but does
not go far enough.  Though these sources are intended for UNIX
systems, good software will run on many platforms and folks are
often trying to run c.s.unix library code on non-UNIX systems.  In
one case I heard about, someone on a Mac wanted to use my old AVL
tree functions and they picked apart the SHAR file with a text
editor.  This seems nonideal.  Therefore I would like to start
archiving *.tar.gz files containing the package applied, and I
would like to do away with the SHAR files altogether.  We would
still keep the patch files separate unless an author wanted to
submit an updated *.tar.gz file with all patches applied.

There's more, though.  Why are we sending SHAR files around, given
that in this era it is possible for all Internet citizens to fetch
(via ftp, www, or ftp-by-mail) any URL they want?  If we're going
to archive by *.tar.gz file, why not put the archives up on WWW (and
FTP, of course) and just post the README files with URL's?  (Note
that I am willing to include the "master URL" for any given package
as an additional data item, but a copy of the *.tar.gz file itself
must be present in the c.s.unix archives before I'd post anything
about it.)  Another benefit of this scheme is that many authors do
not know what a SHAR file is or how to make one -- but *.tar.gz files
are easy to make and use, even on non-UNIX systems.

If you agree with this proposal, please keep silent.  I think it's a
great idea and I expect that all right thinking :-) people will think
so too.

If you do not agree with this proposal, I'd like to hear from you.

XThu Aug 29 1996 - wnl (3.4)
X	Replaced modules (from Tim Pugh): next 32, next40.
X	Fixed bug in username.c: hashing negative uids.
X
XThu Aug 22 1996 - wnl (3.4beta3)
X	Patched modules:  ultrix4, sunos4, sunos5, utek, decosf1, irix5.
X	Added modules: next40, next32.
X	Fixed procstates update bug in display.c.
X	Fixed divide by zero bug in utils.c.
X	Fixed bad number in layout.h
X	Minor fixes to Configure.
X	Complete overhaul of FAQ.
X
XTue Feb 13 1996 - wnl (3.4beta3)
X	Added convex module from Warren Vosper (originally written by
X	William Jones).
X
XTue Feb 13 1996 - wnl (3.4beta2)
X	Fixed format_k in utils.c to calculate K and M values correctly.
X	Added check for gigabyte values ('G').  Changed sumamry_format
X	in display.c to use format_k where appropriate.
X	Changed creation of distribution tar file to place everything in
X	a top level directory.
X
XTue Jan 30 1996 - wnl (3.4beta2)
X	Added m_aix41 module.  Added new tag type to module comments:
X	TERMCAP, which defined the library to use for a termcap library.
X	If no TERMCAP tag is found in the module's initial comment, then
X	Configure will default to "-ltermcap".  AIX needs this since it
X	put all the termcap routines in libcurses(!)
X
X	Added m_bsdos2 (found lingering in my mailbox).
X	Updated m_svr4 to include support for NCR multiprocessors.
X	Fixed small bug in utils.c
X
XThu Jan 25 1996 - wnl (3.4beta1)
X	Fixed m_sunos5 invocation of gettimeofday to include "NULL" as
X	second argument.  This provides compatability with the Posix-
X	compliant template provided with SunOS 5.5, but doesn't hurt
X	previous versions since they do bother with a template for that
X	function.
X
X	Made changes (recommended by net users) to hpux10, ultrix4,
X	netbsd10, aux3 (replaced aux31).  Added module for linux.
X
XFri Oct 10 1995 - wnl (3.4beta1)
X	Added user-contributed modules for SCO Unix, IRIX 5, HP/UX 10,
X	Pyramid DC/OSX.  Changed Configure so that it runs in environments
X	whose c-shells have no 'eval'(!).  Added support for multiple sort
X	ordering methods via the -o switch.  This option requires support
X	from the machine dependent module: such support was added to
X	sunos5 (thus sunos54) and sunos4.
X
X	display.c:  Changed CPU states display line to shorten the leading
X	tag if the data won't fit in the current width.  Fixed a divide-by-
X	zero bug that affected ultrasparc servers (and potentially other
X	systems).
X
X	m_sunos5.c: Now asks the system for the correct pagesize rather than
X	assuming it is 4K.
X
XThu Mar  2 1995 - wnl (3.3 RELEASE)
X	Added module netbsd10 and renamed netbsd to netbsd08.  Changed
X	Configure so that it does not use an initial default module name.
X	Made other compatability fixes to Configure.  Added comments to
X	decosf1 concerning optimizer bug.  Other documentation changes.
X	Added use of "prime.c" to Configure script.
X
XTue Feb  7 1995 - wnl (3.3beta6)
X	Still one more beta....
X	Fixes for sunos5 2.4 gcc core dump (it was an alignment problem).
X	Fixed and improvements for decosf1 (including use of format_k
X	for proper SIZE column formatting).  Added modules freebsd20 and
X	ncr3000.
X
XThu Feb  2 1995 - wnl (3.3beta5)
X	One more beta....
X	Fixed a few bugs in the sunos5 port pertaining to casting and
X	very large memory counts.  Added "ifndef HAVE_GETOPT" to getopt.c
X	to provide for conditional compilation of the getopt function.
X	Those systems that have getopt in libc can add -DHAVE_GETOPT to
X	the CFLAGS line in the module to prevent the function from being
X	compiled.  Added sunos54 module to accomodate SunOS 5.4
X	peculiarities.  Added module for aux3.1.
X
XWed Jan  4 1995 - wnl (3.3beta4)
X	This is really taking too long......sigh.
X	Fixed SIGWINCH handling	once and for all.  It now remembers the
X        number of processes you	want displayed even thru window resizes.
X	Fixed buffer conflict in utils.c (itoa and itoa7).
X        Lots of small improvements to the various modules were made over
X	the past month: too numberous to list here.  SunOS 5 module made
X	more secure thru use of seteuid calls (other SVR4 modules should
X	be modified similarly).  One final MP fix to sunos5, too.  Module
X	for decosf1 was modified to accomodate V3.0.
X
XMon Apr 18 1994 - wnl (3.3beta3)
X	I think I finally got a sunos5 module that will work on MP
X	machines.  Fixed cpu states figure in osmp41a so that 
X	percentages never exceed 100%.  Added shell script "install"
X	since Unix vendors can't seem to make up their minds on what
X	options they want to use for the one that comes with the OS.
X	Added netbsd modules from Christos.  Fixed lots of other little
X	things over the past few months that I have long since forgotten.
X
XWed Dec 15 1993 - wnl (3.3beta2)
X	Added module patches from various users:  hpux9, sunos5.
X	Fixed bug with batch mode (screen_width wasn't getting set).
X	Changes to accomodate 64 bit machines.
X	Fixed some bugs in command parsing ("renice 19 " did something
X	unexpected).
X
XMon Aug 30 1993 - wnl (3.3beta)
X	Added lots of little patches from various users.
X	Added routines to utils.c for intelligent formatting of kilobytes
X	and time.  These are intended to be used in the modules when
X	formatting a process line.  Added code to "summary_format" in
X	display.c to do intelligent formatting of memory quantities.
X	Redid display.c to allow for varying line widths and dynamic
X	reallocation of the screen buffer.
X	Added a SIGWINCH handler to top.c!
X	Added a constant, MAX_COLS, to top.h which defines the absolute
X	widest line we will ever allow.  Changed allocations of "char fmt"
X	in all machine modules to use this constant rather than an abitrary
X	number.
X
XFri Aug 13 1993 - wnl (3.3)
X	Changed return value definition of time-related functions in top.c,
X	display.c, and m_ultrix4.c to time_t (stuart@coral.cs.jcu.edu.au).
X	Fixed bug in display.c: line_update when start != 0.
X
XWed Aug  4 1993 - wnl (3.2 release)
X	Changes to Configure from Paul Vixie.  Added modules for hpux9 and
X	bsd386.
X
XTue Jul 13 1993 - wnl (3.1 release)
X	More small changes and minor bug fixes.  Brought bsd44 up to date
X	and added a module for svr4.2.  Changed shar packaging to use Rich
X	Salz's cshar stuff.
X
XWed Jul  7 1993 - wnl (3.1BETA)
X	More changes and bug fixes to Configure.  Applied some other
X	minor bug fixes and suggestions from the beta testers.  Added
X	the "metatop" shell script and the "installmeta" rule to the
X	Makefile to make handling multiple machine models and OS versions
X	easier.  Added INSTALL and FAQ files.
X
XTue May 18 1993 - wnl (3.1BETA)
X	Changed Configure to be compatible with most SVR4 environments
X	(differing output from "ls -lg").  Also changed Configure,
X	Makefile.X, etc., to look for module files in the subdirectory
X	"machine" (thanks to Christos Zoulas).
X
XTue Apr 20 1993 - wnl (3.1BETA)
X	Changed both occurences of "ls -1" in Configure to "ls".  This
X	SHOULD produce the same result, and has the advantage that it
X	doesn't produce an error on a system 5 machine.  Integrated other
X	changes recommended in the first round of beta testing.
X
XWed Mar 10 1993 - wnl (3.1BETA)
X	MAJOR CHANGE:  I have added a required function to all machine
X	dependent modules, called proc_owner.  It takes a pid as an argument
X	and returns the uid of the process's owner.  Such capability is 
X	necessary for top to run securely as a set-uid program, something
X	that is needed for SVR4 implementations to read /proc.  I have
X	retrofitted all modules except dgux with this function, but was
X	not able to test most of them.  Top should now run securely as
X	a setuid program.  Added 386bsd and sunos5 modules.  Added sunos4mp
X	module for MP Suns.
X
XSat Feb 20 1993 - wnl (3.1ALPHA)
X	Modified top.c and commands.c to compile correctly on System V
X	derived Unixes (especially SVR4), but in a way that doesn't rely
X	on an oracle-like declaration (that is, I don't use "ifdef SYSV").
X	Fixed some bugs in "Configure" and "getans".  Added inspection of
X	env variable "TOP" for options, and made -I default to showing
X	idle processes.  Added "u" command to change username restriction
X	on the fly.  Created shell script "suntop" for poor multi-version
X	SunOS folks (like myself).
X
XWed Jun  3 1992 - wnl (3.0)
X	"max_topn" wasn't being used everywhere it was supposed to be
X	in top.c.  Many cosmetic changes, including copyright notices in
X	all the .c files.  Version number is now handled by version.c and
X	reflects the current patchlevel (which is initially set to 0).
X	Changed Configure and Makefile to allow configurable variables for
X	certain commands:  shell, cc, awk, install.  Updated README and
X	Porting.  Ready to release to the world!
X
XMon May 18 1992 - wnl (2.9BETA)
X	Added modules provided by Christos Zoulas.  Replaced screen.c
X	with one modified by Christos and that will appropriately select
X	and handle the sgtty, termio, or termios system.  Integrated many
X	other changes recommended by Christos.  Fixed (I hope) the "-b"
X	batch mode display bug.  Had to change loadavg to load_avg to avoid
X	a conflict with 4.4BSD.  
X
XMon Apr 27 1992 - wnl (2.8BETA)
X	Added modules provided by Daniel Trinkle.  Added patchlevel.h,
X	but the patch level is not yet reflected in the version number.
X	Cleaned up m_sunos4.c a little.
X
XWed Apr 22 1992 - wnl (2.8BETA)
X	Major internal reorganization.  All of the system dependent stuff
X	is now really and truly separated from everything else.  The
X	system dependent functions are contained in a separate .c file
X	called a "module".  The Configure script knows how to find and
X	set up these modules, but the human installer still needs to tell
X	Configure which module to use (no automagic determination of 
X	machine type---sorry).  Added -U option to specify one user's
X	processes, but there is no corresponding command...yet.  Other
X	changes and improvements too numerous to mention here.  Currently
X	there are only two modules:  sunos4 and umax.  But after this beta
X	release is sent around, I expect more to be written.  I just hope
X	that the machine-dependent abstractions don't need to change in
X	the process.
X
XThu Mar 26 1992 - wnl (2.7BETA)
X	Beta release with minimal architecture support.  Updated README
X	and added a first cut at a Porting guide.  Added ioctl TIOCGWINSZ
X	code from top2.5+ (courtesy of David MacKenzie).  I didn't even
X	try porting the Ultrix support since I don't have access to an
X	Ultrix machine.
X
XFri Oct 11 1991 - wnl (2.6)
X	This version was not widely released.  It contained many changes.
X	Here are the major ones:
X
X	Put in Vixie's idle process hack.
X
X	Enhanced type field in new_message to handle delayed messages.
X
X	Changed u_process to automatically adjust for varying lines of
X	output.  Management of screenbuf should now be completely contained
X	in display.c.  Removed now extraneous code from CMD_number[12]
X	portion of command switch in top.c.  This was the stuff that dealt
X	with zeroing out lines in screenbuf.
X
X	Finally made it all work correctly on a 386i.  Problems I had to
X	overcome: kvm_nlist doesn't return 0 on success as advertised (it
X	returns 1 instead); the results of a kvm_nlist are different
X	(n_type can be zero even for a symbol that exists).
X
X	Serious rearrangement for processor dependent stuff.  All nlists
X	are now in separate files with the suffix ".nlist".  Most machine
X	specific code is in "machine.c" surrounded by appropriate ifdefs---
X	the goal is to eventually have all machine specific code in this
X	file.  Managed to find a way to detect SunOS 4.x at compile-time:
X	this is contained in the include file "sun.h".  Completely changed
X	the memory display line for SunOS 4.x---it now displays a far
X	more appropriate report.
X
X	Created the shell script "Configure" to aid in the configuration
X	step.
X
X	Fixed a bug in init_termcap:  it will now tolerate an environment
X	which does not have TERM defined (thanks to Sam Horrocks for
X	pointing this out).
X
XTue Aug  9 1988 - wnl (2.5)
X	Added changes to make top work under version 4.0 of the Sun
X	operating system.  Changes were provided by Scott Alexander of the
X	University of Pennsylvania.  Thanks!  Compile with "-Dsunos4" to
X	get them.  Virtual memory statistics are not readily accessible
X	under 4.0, so they don't show up in the output.
X
XThu Jul 31 1987 - wnl (2.4)
X	Fixed a problem with the 4.0 Pyramid code.  The label "cp_time"
X	doesn't exist in the 4.0 kernel anymore.  I think the code Carl
X	sent me wants "percpu" instead.  That is what I am using and it
X	appears to work.  375 code is still untested (at least by me).
X	Also picked a great deal of lint out of the source.  Lint now only
X	complains about a very few nitpicky things (there are far too many
X	calls to "printf" to put a "(void)" in front of!), at least under
X	SunOS.
X
XTue Jul 28 1987 - wnl (2.4a)
X	Added changes for a Symmetrics Computer Systems s/375 machine.
X	Changes were provided by Paul Vixie.  Thanks!  According to Mr.
X	Vixie:  "These changes were not made at, by, or for SCS proper.
X	SCS would probably be interested in them, but so far only the
X	users' group has them.  They were made in February, 1987, to
X	version 2.1 of the program, by Paul Vixie
X	(dual!ptsfa!vixie!paul@ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU)."  His changes were
X	integrated into version 2.3 to make version 2.4.
X
X	The SCS peculiarities are summarized in Changes.scs.
X
XTue Jun  9 1987 - wnl (2.3 for real)
X	Changed the includes for the extra code Carl sent me to only
X	compile on Version 4.0 Pyramid machines.  This makes top still
X	compilable on pre-4.0 Pyramids.  Specifically, this code is only
X	compiled when both "pyr" and "CPUFOUND" are defined.
X
XWed Jun  3 1987 - wnl (2.3 with Pyramid additions)
X	It's been a month and I still haven't done anything about
X	distributing this version.  However, Carl Gutekunst from Pyramid
X	has sent me some extra patches for some of the Pyramid code.  I
X	just added those and will make them part of 2.3.  This fixes the
X	following Pyramid problems:  adds the inclusion of <sys/systm.h>,
X	uses the correct size for getting the kernel value _ccpu (this bug
X	affected the Vax version as well), sums the elements of the percpu
X	array to calculate a cp_time value (for OSx 4.0).
X
XFri May  1 1987 - wnl (2.3)
X	I have finally finished all the changes for better support of
X	oddbal terminals.  Added the low-level routine "clear_eol" which
X	makes handling terminals without "ce" easy:  it uses spaces
X	instead.  All direct uses of "clear_line" outside of screen.c have
X	been changed to use this primitive.  A terminal with "os" is now
X	handled in such that all situations that need overwriting are
X	completely avoided (including several commands).  This required
X	some changes to the way commands are translated into action (in
X	"top.c").  Made several important changes to display.c to prevent
X	overflowing of any of the fields.  Specifically, more than 99
X	total processes and a cpu state that reaches 100%.  Had to make a
X	small change to two casts in top.c, because the Sun 3.2 compiler
X	was giving warnings on them.  Added the "-q" option which lets
X	root run top at a nice of -20 (in case he thinks he really needs it).
X
XTue Dec 30 1986 - wnl (2.2)
X	I think I fixed a bug reported by Julian Onions at Nottingham.
X	Occasionally, top will core dump when the sprintf in either
X	i_process or u_process overflows due to an exceptionally
X	unrealistic time value.  I think it highly unlikely that top can
X	get a bad proc structure (although I suppose it is possible), but
X	the process time is read from the user structure, and that can
X	sometimes be part garbage.  So, "get_ucpu" checks the value it
X	returns to make sure its formatted form will not overflow the
X	sprintf.  If this doesn't fix the bug, then more drastic measures
X	will be necessary.  I plan to make this version the official
X	"top 2.2".  [[ This version was never distributed very widely. ]]
X
XTue Dec  2 1986 - wnl (2.2c)
X	Added to top.c the notion of a "failed command".  When a command
X	produces a message (on the message line), an update does not
X	follow it.  Before, the message was written and a new display was
X	shown---purposefully not overwriting the message.  But the
X	improvements to handle overstriking terminals and terminals
X	without "ce" clear the screen before every display, which would
X	erase the message.  Now, the message is displayed and top waits
X	another full time interval before updating the display.  This
X	works much better all around.
X
XMon Nov 24 1986 - wnl (2.2b)
X	Created a new file, utils.c, and made appropriate changes to
X	Makefile.  This new file holds all utility functions that can and
X	may be used by more than one "module".  Improved i_memory and
X	u_memory (display.c) so that screen updates for the values
X	displayed are only changed when necessary.  Also made the line
X	look better:  the last fixes made for a rather ugly display.
X	Added the locally defined constant "LoadMax" and added code to
X	top.c to send the cursor home after a space command is entered if
X	the load average is higher than "LoadMax".  This provides visual
X	feedback on loaded systems.
X
XMon Nov  3 1986 - wnl (2.2a)
X	Widened the format for memory usage so that it can display 5
X	digits.  This makes that line look a little ugly---maybe I'll fix
X	that later.  Screen handling now understands "os" and a missing
X	"ce".  It treats them identically:  clear the screen between each
X	display.  Screen handling code now uses "cd" when appropriate
X	(i.e.:  when user has shortened the screen).  Made i_loadave clear
X	then screen and took out most of the explicit calls to "clear" in
X	top.c.  This method is cleaner, especially in conjunction with
X	"os" handling.  Added preprocessor variable "RANDOM_PW" for
X	systems that access the passwd file randomly (Sun's yp and 4.3).
X	With "RANDOM_PW" set, "getpwuid" is used instead of "getpwnam",
X	but uid->username mappings are still hashed internally (because
X	that is still faster than going to disk).
X
XMon Oct  6 1986 - wnl (2.1)
X	A bug with the kill command was pointed out by "dciem!tim"---
X	specifying a signal by name did not work correctly.  This bug has
X	been fixed with a simple change to commands.c.  Another bug made
X	the cpu state percentages incorrect the first time they were
X	displayed.  This bug has also been fixed (changed top.c).
X
XThu Sep  4 1986 - wnl (2.0, at last)
X	This is the version that will (hopefully) get released to the
X	world as top 2.0.
X	Added the "r" and "k" commands for renice and kill, respectively.
X	This required adding a way to handle system call errors, and the
X	addition of the "e" command.  Help screen and manual page were
X	changed to reflect this change.  Changed all "#ifdef SUN" directives
X	to "#ifdef sun", and changed all "#ifdef PYRAMID" directives to
X	"#ifdef pyr".  As much as I hate those choices of preprocessor
X	names (they too easily conflict with real variable names), it does
X	make automatic compilation possible---people don't have to change
X	the Makefile anymore for specific machines.  The manual page was
X	changed to automatically incorporate the defaults as set in the
X	Makefile (including an infinite value for TOPN) and the way the
X	manual page is generated by the Makefile was changed to make
X	maintenance of this information automatic.
X
XMon Jul 28 1986 - wnl (still pre 2.0)
X	Real close now.  I put in a new definition for the macro "pagetok"
X	that does an explicit shift of a constant expression involving
X	PGSHIFT.  Appropriate checks are made if PGSHIFT is to small.
X	"pagetok" is now used exclusively everywhere to convert kernel
X	clicks to kilobytes.  I added a full blown interactive mode with
X	the ability to change some of the runtime parameters (how many to
X	display, time delay, etc.) while top is running.  I also
X	incorporated a few ideas from the net:  control characters in the
X	command name are replaced with '?'; the '-S' option makes the
X	swapper and pager visible; options have been added to control the
X	number of displays produced (this makes it easier to make
X	performance snapshots with top).  I have also added the notion of
X	"infinite" values for number of processes and number of displays.
X	I fixed a long-standing bug in the uid to username mapping code
X	that was only aggravated on the pyramids:  it was an ill-defined
X	expression (akin to i = i++).  I tweaked the proc_compar routine
X	for qsort slightly so that stopped processes were more likely to
X	show up.  Manual page was updated to reflect all changes
X	noticeable to the user.
X
XTue Jul  1 1986 - wnl (pre 2.0 -- 1.9999?)
X	In the process of major revamping on the way to version 2.0.
X	I have completely done away with curses by adding my own screen
X	management routines in a separate file (screen.c).  The rationale
X	for this is that top knows a whole lot more about what is and is
X	not redundant on the screen and can compare simple integer values
X	where curses would have to compare strings.  This has turned out
X	to be a very big win speed-wise.  The proc_compar routine for
X	sorting has been rewritten to include several more keys.  I
X	decided this was necessary when I noticed that the "top" process
X	itself kept disappearing off the top 10 list on a Sun-3.  All the
X	processes had the same percentage (0%) and the sort wasn't really
X	doing anything worthwhile.  I changed the expression that computes
X	memory usage to use the ctob macro instead of just assuming that
X	pages were 512 bytes.  More work still needs to be done before
X	this version is usable.  I changed options-processing to use
X	getopt and added appropriate incantations to the Makefile.
X
XWed Feb 20 1985 - wnl (still 1.8)
X	Put in the ifdef FOUR_ONE statements to make top still compilable
X	on a 4.1 system.  Apparently, there are some users out there that
X	need this functionality.  Oh well.  I don't guarantee any of it,
X	since I can't test it.  Made appropriate changes to README and
X	final installation related changes to Makefile.
X
XSat Feb  2 1985 - wnl (1.8)
X	Removed all the ifdef FOUR_TWO statements and made "top" into a
X	4.2 only program.  If someone really wants to still run it on 4.1,
X	then they can do all the work.  We don't have a 4.1 machine
X	anymore, so I don't even know if the thing still works under 4.1.
X	Cleaned up the Makefile and the README.  Added installation rules
X	to the Makefile, as requested by several sites.  Fixed a very
X	obscure divide-by-zero bug.  Added a second "key" to the qsort
X	comparison function (proc_compar) so that comparisons are based on
X	cpu ticks if the percentages are equal (provided by Jonathon
X	Feiber at Sun).
X
XTue Dec 11 1984 - wnl (1.7)
X	Added the virtual and real memory status line to the header area
X	(provided by Jonathon Feiber at Sun)
X
XTue Nov 20 1984 - wnl (1.6)
X	Added an "exit" if sbrk's fail.  Added changes from Jonathon
X	Feiber at Sun:  ifdef SUN to make top work on Suns (they don't use
X	doubles in the proc structure), register declarations, check for
X	getting a user structure that has disappeared since the proc array
X	was read (it used to die, now it just shows the process as swapped).
X
XTue Nov 13 1984 - wnl (1.5)
X	If the number of displayable processes ("active_procs") was less
X	than the number of requested processes ("topn"), top would
X	segmentation fault.  This bug has been fixed.  Thanks to Prentiss
X	Riddle at ut-sally for pointing out the existence of this bug.

X	Finally fixed the hash table bug that caused processes owned by
X	root to sometimes appear with either no name or a different name
X	that had UID 0 (such as "operator").  Removed all the ifdef DEBUG
X	blocks to make top ready for distribution to the real world.
X
XSun Apr  8 1984 - wnl (still 1.3)
X	Made some slight changes to the display format.  It now looks more
X	aesthetically pleasing.  Added some preprocessor constants so that
X	the two defaults (number of processes and seconds of delay) easier
X	to change.

XThu Apr  5 1984 - wnl (1.3)
X	Changed the order in which things are done at initialization time.
X	This way, if an error occurs before starting the main loop, curses
X	will never get started.  Also changed other error handlers so that
X	endwin() is called before any flavor of exit.  Specifying a number
X	of processes that is more than the screen can handle is no longer
X	fatal.  It displays a warning message and pretends the user
X	specified the maximum for the screen.  Finally cured all the TSTP
X	blues (well, almost all).  I removed my TSTP handler and convinced
X	the system to always use the one that curses sets up.  Turns out
X	that "sleep" was stepping all over it during a pause.  So, I don't
X	use sleep anymore.  The only problem that remains with it now is
X	redrawing the old display before updating it after a pause.
X
XTue Apr  3 1984 - wnl (from 1.0 to 1.2)
X	I changed the format of the TIME column from just "seconds" to
X	"minutes:seconds".  I also made pausing work correctly.  Screen
X	redraws with an up to date display.  For compatibility with 4.2, I
X	changed the name of the "zero" function to "bzero".  The makefile
X	has been altered to handle versions for 4.1 and 4.2, and README
X	has been updated to reflect these recent changes.

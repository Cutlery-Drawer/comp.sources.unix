Posting-Number: Volume 29, Issue 71
Archive-Name: top-3.3//patch01

This is official patch #1 to top-3.3 from volume29.

Top version 3.3 as distributed will not compile under Solaris 2.5,
thanks to a compatability "fix" that Sun pulled out of its hat.

To fix this problem, do the following:

0. Make sure you are using a shell on your Solaris 2.5 machine

1. Change your working directory to the main source directory for top
   (the one that contains "Configure", "top.c", etc.)

2. Drop the enclosed file in to "machine/m_sunos55.c"

3. Type "./Configure" and use "sunos55" for a module name, then answer all
   the other questions appropriately (note: if you do not need to make any
   changes to the configuration other than the module name you can just
   use the command "./Configure sunos55")

4. Type "make"


This fix will be incorporated in to top 3.4 in some form or another.

Now everybody can STOP sending me mail about this!  :-)

/*
 * top - a top users display for Unix
 *
 * SYNOPSIS:  Any Sun running SunOS 5.5 (Solaris 2.5).
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 * This is the machine-dependent module for SunOS 5.5 (Solaris 2.5).
 * There is some support for MP architectures.
 * This makes top work on the following systems:
 *         SunOS 5.5
 *
 * LIBS: -lkvm -lelf 
 *
 * Need -I. for all the top include files which are searched for in machine/,
 * because of the way include "file" finds files.
 *
 * Need -D_SVID_GETTOD because of a change that Sun made to the definition
 * of gettimeofday:  OS versions 5.4 and lower only used one argument,
 * contrary to the emerging standard, version 5.5 now follows the standard
 * of having two arguments which now (unfortunately) makes the m_sunos5
 * module incompatible.
 *
 * CFLAGS: -I. -DHAVE_GETOPT -DSOLARIS24 -D_SVID_GETTOD

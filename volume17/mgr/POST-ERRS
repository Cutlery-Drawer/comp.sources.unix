I got off-by-one on posting MGR for one day's worth of postings.

    <1368@papaya.bbn.com>	v17i018:  MGR, Bellcore window manager, Part18/61
	This is really Part 17
    <1369@papaya.bbn.com>	v17i019:  MGR, Bellcore window manager, Part19/61
	This is really Part 18
    <1370@papaya.bbn.com>	v17i020:  MGR, Bellcore window manager, Part20/61
	This is really Part 19
    <1371@papaya.bbn.com>	v17i021:  MGR, Bellcore window manager, Part21/61
	This is really Part 20
    <1377@papaya.bbn.com>	v17i022:  MGR, Bellcore window manager, Part21/61
	This is really Part 21

Also, the first few parts will give incorrect counts when unpacking some
of the UUENCODED files; ignore that.  The reason is that I gave uudecode
the wrong names, so I edited the files in-place after packing to remove
the full pathnames.

That is, I did
	uuencode <icon/clockA >icon/clockA.UU
which meant that the file that was packed had this line in it:
	begin icon/clockA 644
This made it a real pain to decode after unpacking, so I edited
the files to just read like this:
	begin clockA 644
and that threw off the shar counts.

Also the README2 files say that things are named something.UU, when
they're (obviously) named Usomething.

For people who don't want to wait, the full posting is already on
UUNET for downloading.  Discussion of the package should probably be
directed to comp.windows.misc on Usenet.

Mod.sources:  Volume 4, Issue 74
Submitted by: decvax!genrad!panda!sources (John P. Nelson - the moderator)

This is the table of contents for the mod.sources archive as of 4/15/86.

News:
 o Ron Saad (cmcl2!ron1!ron) is temporarily unable to provide archive access,
   as he is changing his location.
 o I am no longer providing mod.sources tape archive copying to the general
   public.  See the access info for a more complete explaination.
 o The mod.sources Index presentation has been reorganized:

I was asked if I could provide a diff posting of this Index (like the
mod.newslists postings) so that people don't have to wade through
through the old information each month.  The idea was good, but it is
impractical for this file - the diffs are generally large.  Instead, I
will be providing a summary of changes at the top (if any), followed by
the new files this month, followed by the archive information, followed
by the Index (Volume 1 LAST).  Hopefully this new ordering will better
serve the readership.

		ACCESSING THE MOD.SOURCES ARCHIVE

There are several active archive sites.  Please attempt to contact one of
these before contacting me for archive retreival - so I can concentrate on
moderating the newsgroup.


1.  Robert Elz (seismo!munnari!kre), provides archive access in Australia
    contact him for more details.

2.  Rick Adams (rick@seismo) provides archive access to those on the ARPA
    net.  Access is available directly via ftp (7pm to 9am EST only!!!!!!)
    The files are in a directory mod.sources, then a sub-directory Volume[1-4].
    The are named as close as possible to the names in the Index.  Files that
    have not been assigned a "short name" reside in the directory sources/mod

3.  David Barto (sdcsvax!celerity!barto) privides access to the California
    Area.   David has semi-automated his archive retreival system.
    People should send the 'moderators short titles' surrounded by 'BEGIN'
    and 'END' on lines by themselves, followed by a return address from any
    one of 'ihnp4, berkeley, akgua, sdcsvax'.  Arpanet addresses are acceptable

    Thus to request the 'Public domain Terminfo/Curses (needs work)',
    'dynamic string package' and 'replacement for system(3)'
    the user should mail:

blah blah blah.....

BEGIN
pcurses
vstr
command
END
ihnp4!foo!bar!place!mysite!me
blah blah blah.

    You can Contact David at:

    decvax-\    bang-\                 ARPA: celerity!barto@sdcsvax.ARPA
    ucbvax--\   akgua-\
    ihnp4----\-sdcsvax-\-celerity!barto

Remember, none of the archive people have infinite free time.  If you request
part of the archive be sent via uucp mail (i.e. the archive person must be
directly involved) PLEASE restrict your request to just a few modules (note
that many sources are made up of multiple modules).  Also, PLEASE provide
the archive person with a return address starting from a well known site,
especially if you are on a network, and mail goes through gateways that
may munge return addresses.  Otherwise you may never recieve a reply!

I am always receptive to adding new archive sites - if you are interested,
please contact me.

I used to provide tape archive retrieval.  Folks, I just can't keep up
with the number of tape requests I'm getting.  It doesn't help that there
are a large number of people sending special requests - they want it sent
COD, or Federal express (collect) or sent via one of 4 different courier
services.  Sorry, but I just don't have the TIME to sort all that out.  (This
isn't a buisness, this is my FREE TIME!)  I will try to get all the tapes
I currently have queued up done this week, but I will not be accepting any
more requests.  If you absolutely MUST get a tape - make sure you contact
me first!!!!  I can provide 6250bpi or 1600bpi "tar" format tapes only, and
The whole archive still fits on one 1600bpi tape.  I am happy to copy the
sources onto tape for anyone who wants to re-distribute mod.sources. I hope
someone volunteers to take over general tape archive retrieval.

Note that I am still providing uucp mail archive access, so if you have
problems with one of the other sites, you can send mail to me.
Send archive requests to panda!sources-request.  (full address below)

Please send new sources for posting to panda!sources.  Postings are usually
processed within 24 hrs.  If you want verification of arrival, please mention
that in a cover letter (or at the top of your submission, if it is small).
I try to verify that a program works, and if I can't get it to work, I may
hold up posting it for a few days.

Mod.sources:  Volume 4, Issue 121
Submitted by: decvax!genrad!panda!sources (John P. Nelson - the moderator)

This is the table of contents for the mod.sources archive as of 5/15/86.

News:

 o David Barto is no longer providing Archive access.  This means that
   there is no longer a uucp (mail) based archive site.

 o Rick Adams (rick@seismo) is taking over tape archive access.

 o There is now a CSNET archive access mechanism.

 o I am resigning as moderator.  Rich $alz (rs@mirror) has volunteered
   to take over.  He is not set up yet, but expect an announcement soon.

                ACCESSING THE MOD.SOURCES ARCHIVE

There are several active archive sites.  Please attempt to contact one of
these rather than contacting me for Archive retrieval.


1.  Robert Elz (seismo!munnari!kre), provides archive access in Australia
    contact him for more details.

2.  Rick Adams (rick@seismo.CSS.GOV) provides archive access to those on the
    ARPAnet.  Access is available directly via anonymous ftp (Outside of
    9am-7pm EST M-F.) The files are in a directory mod.sources, then a
    sub-directory Volume[1-4]. They are named as closely as possible to the
    names in the Index.  Files that have not been assigned a "short name"
    reside in the directory sources/mod temporarily.

    Tape access is also available. Send a 1/2" mag tape WITH RETURN
    POSTAGE and RETURN MAILING container to:
        Rick Adams
        Center for Seismic Studies
        1300 North 17th Street, Suite 1450
        Arlington, VA 22209-3871

    Tapes without return postage or mailer will NOT be returned.
    No other methods (including COD, etc) are available. Please don't ask.

 
3.  The CSNET CIC provides archive access to CSNET sites.  This access
    is automated.   You need simply mail a message in appropriate format
    to the CSNET Info Server (info@csnet-sh.arpa or info@sh.cs.net) to retrieve
    distributions.  For more details about this service, contact the
    CIC at cic@sh.cs.net.


Sorry, there do not seem to be any uucp/mail based archive sites left.
I am afraid that I simply CANNOT afford the time to provide this service
myself.  Besides, I have found that mail/uucp has gotten fairly unreliable
(I keep getting flames from people, that I never replied to their mail -
Most of the time, I never GOT their mail!).  Remember,  If you send
correspondence to me or one of the archive sites, PLEASE include a
return address starting from a well known site, ESPECIALLY if your mail
is liable to go through gateway sites.  I have gotten fairly number of
mail messages that I could not reply to.

I am always receptive to adding new archive sites - if you are interested,
please contact me.  If you offered, and did not hear from me again - please
send mail again - your mail (or mine) probably got lost.

Please send new sources for posting to panda!sources.  Postings are usually
processed within 24 hrs.  If you want verification of arrival, please mention
that in a cover letter (or at the top of your submission, if it is small).
I try to verify that a program works, and if I can't get it to work, I may
hold up posting it for a few days.

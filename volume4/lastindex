Mod.sources:  Volume 4, Issue 37
Submitted by: decvax!genrad!panda!sources (John P. Nelson - the moderator)


This is the table of contents for the mod.sources archive as of 3/15/86.

There are several active archive sites.  Please attempt to contact one of
these before contacting me for archive retreival - so I can concentrate on
moderating the newsgroup.


1.  Robert Elz (seismo!munnari!kre), provides archive access in Australia
    contact him for more details.

2.  Rick Adams (rick@seismo) provides archive access to those on the ARPA
    net.  Access is available directly via ftp (7pm to 9am EST only!!!!!!)
    The files are in a directory mod.sources, then a sub-directory Volume[1-4].
    The are named as close as possible to the names in the Index.  Files that
    have not been assigned a "short name" reside in the directory sources/mod

3.  Ron Saad  (cmcl2!ron1!ron) provides archive access to the New York
    area.  Ron has also set up direct uucp access.   Contact him directly
    for more complete information.
    UUCP:       ...{ihnp4,seismo}!{philabs,cmcl2}!ron1!ron
    MAIL:       333 Jay St. Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201

4.  David Barto (sdcsvax!celerity!barto) privides access to the California
    Area.   David has semi-automated his archive retreival system.
    People should send the 'moderators short titles' surrounded by 'BEGIN'
    and 'END' on lines by themselves, followed by a return address from any
    one of 'ihnp4, berkeley, akgua, sdcsvax'.  Arpanet addresses are acceptable

    Thus to request the 'Public domain Terminfo/Curses (needs work)',
    'dynamic string package' and 'replacement for system(3)'
    the user should mail:

blah blah blah.....

BEGIN
pcurses
vstr
command
END
ihnp4!foo!bar!place!mysite!me
blah blah blah.

    You can Contact David at:

    decvax-\    bang-\                 ARPA: celerity!barto@sdcsvax.ARPA
    ucbvax--\   akgua-\
    ihnp4----\-sdcsvax-\-celerity!barto

Remember, none of the archive people have infinite free time.  If you request
part of the archive be sent via uucp mail (i.e. the archive person must be
directly involved) PLEASE restrict your request to just a few modules (note
that many sources are made up of multiple modules).  Also, PLEASE provide
the archive person with a return address starting from a well known site,
especially if you are on a network, and mail goes through gateways that
may munge return addresses.  Otherwise you may never recieve a reply!

I am always receptive to adding new archive sites - if you are interested,
please contact me.

I don't believe that any of the above archive sites are providing tape
archive retrieval, so I am still providing that service.  If you send a
9 track tape along with a self-addressed, stamped mailer (along with a
note explaining which sources are being requested), then I will put the
archives onto the tape in either 6250bpi or 1600bpi "tar" format (sorry,
no cpio).  Note that the entire archive currently fits on one full-size
reel of tape at 1600bpi.  Note: tapes that arrive without proper
mailers/postage will become the property of the moderator!

Note that I am still providing uucp mail archive access, so if you have
problems with one of the other sites, you can send mail to me.
Send archive requests to panda!sources-request.  (full address below)

Please send new sources for posting to panda!sources.  Postings are usually
processed within 24 hrs.

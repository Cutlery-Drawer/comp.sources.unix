X	MicroEMACS 3.6	new goodies
X
X- CMODE additions
X
X	in CMODE, pressing a '#' when there is only preceding whitespace
Xon a line causes the whitespace to be deleted.  (for preprocesser
Xcommands to be brought up against the left margin. 
X
X- Next Buffer command
X
X	The Next Buffer command (^X-X) switches the current window to
Xthe next buffer in the buffer list (reading it in if needed).  This is
Xgood for editing lists of files (mainly on UNIX when the shell expands
Xwild cards). 
X
X- Fill paragraph modified
X
X	The fill paragraph command (<ESC> Q) now puts two spaces after
Xevery period at the end of a word.  This is useful most of the time but
Xoccasionally will put in spurious spaces (like after a middle initial). 
XAny suggestions on an algorithm for dealing with english would be
Xappreciated. 
X
X- Kill paragraph command added
X
X	<ESC> ^W is now bound to kill-paragraph.  This kills the current
Xparagraph which the cursor is in.  A numeric argument will allow it to
Xkill a number of paragraphs. 
X
X- Global mode commands
X
X	Set/delete global mode commands now allow the user to specify a
Xdefault mode for newly created buffers.  Thus, for example, if you
Xalways wished to use EXACT case matching on a string, you could place a
X"Set global mode exact" in your startup file and all buffers would start
Xwith EXACT initially on. 
X
X- Overwrite mode
X
X	OVER mode allows you to type text over the top of other text
Xwithout inserting it.  This mode is very good for editing tables of
Xinformation. 
X
X- Insert Space command added
X
X	The Insert Space command (^C or INSERT) inserts a space in front
Xof the cursor push any text to the right one character farther to the
Xright.  This is a very usefull command while in OVERwrite mode. (I moved
Xthe bind-to-key function to now initially be bound to <ESC>-K)
X
X- Hunt Forward/Backward
X
X	The hunt commands allow you to search for the last string
Xsearched for without re-entering the string. Under PCDOS they are bound
Xto <ALT>-S and <ALT-R> (the new function prefix proved even more
Xverstile than I had thought when I wrote it. Do note the unusual
Xdeclarations for them in EBIND.H) Under other environments they are not
Xyet bound, and are probably best bound to a function key.
X
X- Amiga Function/Cursor keys:
X
X	are now supported. Function keys 1-10 are FN 0 - FN 9, shifted
Xfunction keys are FN P - FN Y, cursor keys are FN A - FN D, shifted
Xcursor keys are FN S, FN T, FN a, and FN @. (Use the describe-key
Xfunction to find specific keys).
X
X- Reverse video Status lines
X
X	The status line for each buffer can now (due to popular demand)
Xbe in reverse video. This is configuable in ESTRUCT.H for people who
Xmight not want it.
X
X- Several Bug fixes:
X
X	A bug in DOBUF would cause non-terminated strings under some
Xcompilers has been fixed.
X
X	Tabs when expanded on the AMIGA at display time sometimes caused
XMicroEMACS to hang, this is fixed. (Reported by Dawn Banks)
X
X	The current column position was not always maintained properly
Xwhen executing a keyboard macro, this is fixed. (Reported by Ernst Christen).
X
X	Re-wrote word wrapping algorithm to be have better when
Xinserting text into the middle of a paragraph.
X
X	<NL>'s at the end of a search to replace string cause the
Xreplacement to terminate after they have done the first replacement on
Xthe last line of the file, preventing MicroEMACS to hang while infinitly
Xreplacing <NL>s.
X
X
X- Future enhancments may include:
X
X	-s on command line for alternative startup file
X	numbered kill buffers
X	fence matching for CMODE
X	sort region command
X	sentence movement and deletion commands
X
X	If you make modifications to let MicroEMACS 3.6 run under any
Xnew envirnments, please send me the changes. I am also looking for the
Xinclude file "rainbow.h".
X
X	Could some please test this out under the Mark Williams C
Xcompiler (which I do not have) and send me any needed changes to have it
Xrun properly [most probably in termio.c].
X
X	Send any ideas, suggestions or futher goodies to

X
X=============================================================================
X	MicroEMACS 3.5
X
X	This version of MicroEMACS is based on the version written by
XDave G. Conroy, and latter modified by Steve Wilhite and George Jones.
XMy thanks goes to them for writting such nice, well structured and
Xdocumented code. It is nice to see that there are some people out there
Xwho know how to program well.
X
X	I intend to continue to maintain this version and will consider
Xadding features and supported machines on request. Current hardware
Xsupported includes:
X
X	IBM-PC under PCDOS/MSDOS and many compatibles
X	Dec Rainbow
X	Commodore Amiga
X	Unix V7
X	Unix and Multix BSD 4.2
X	Hewlett Packard 150 and various upgrades
X
XFeatures added to MicroEMACS since version 2.0 include:
X
X- Meta repeat codes
X
X	Striking the <ESC> key followed by a numeric argument (possibly
Xwith a leading minus sign) passes an argument down to a command which is
Xusually used as a repeat count. This is similar to the ^U command, but
Xthere is no default value.
X
X- Change in repositioning command
X
X	The command to reposition the cursor now repositions it, by
Xdefault, to the center of the current window, rather than the first line
Xof the window. This I think is much more usefull and also consistant
Xwith many other emacs'.
X
X- File writting message....
X
X	For those of us with big files, when you start a write of a file
Xto disk, the message [Writing..] now appears. This is so we know the
Xmachine is really still there. (Paranoids Ahead!)
X
X- Search strings now can have <NL>s in them
X
X	It is very usefull to be able to have newlines in search and
Xreplace strings. To do this, all text input to searching commands is now
Xterminated by an <ESC>.
X
X- Replace!!!!!
X
X	Yes, now we can replace as well as search. There are two flavors
Xof this command. <ESC> R allows us to replace each occurence of a string
Xwith another string from the current point to the end of the file. 
X<ESC> ^R also queries us at each string to see if we want to replace it.
XTyping a question mark here will display the options.
X
X- Yes/no responces
X
X	no longer require (or want) a return typed after them.
X
X- Spawning
X
X	Fixed up some MSDOS spawning messages. WARNING: If you have your
Xswitchchar set to a '-' instead of a '/' Lattice C may have problems
Xwhen yanking up a new command processer. It will use a line like 
XCOMMAND /C <command line>. You may have to rewrite this library function
Xto get it to work on your system properly.
X
X- Suspend MicroEMACS
X
X	Under Unix BSD 4.2 we now have code to put the editor into the
Xbackground and return to the parent shell. This is initially bound to
Xthe ^X D keys.
X
X- Function keys
X
X	Under MSDOS on IBM-PCs and compatibles, the function keys and
Xcursor arrows now do what one would expect them to. There is a new
Xprefix in the editor to accodate this. (Look in MAIN.C for this) This
Xcan be used to add function key support to most any machine by adding a
Xsmall piece of code to reconize the keys in the getkey() routine in
Xmain.c, and adding the new definitions to the ebind.h header file.
X
X- Abort (^G)
X
X	now prints out [Aborted] on the command line so you know what
Xhappened.
X
X- Editor Modes
X
X	Buffers now have modes associated with them. These modes can be
Xset with the set-mode (^X M) and the delete-mode (^X ^M) commands.
X
X- CMODE mode
X
X	When a file is read in with a .c or .h extention, CMODE is set
Xfor that buffer. (This can also be manually set/deleted[see above]) In
XCMODE, MicroEMACS attemts to be intelligent about doing automatic
Xindentation for you. It will indent any line the same as the privious
Xline unless the last line ended with a brace ({). Then it will indent an
Xextra tab stop (which varies depending on how tabs are set). Any lines
Xbegining with a close brace (}) will by undented one tab stop if possible.
X
X- WRAP mode
X
X	This mode automatically wraps words onto the next line when the
Xword extends beyond the current fill column.
X
X- VIEW mode
X
X	This mode disables all commands that can change the current buffer.
X
X- EXACT mode
X
X	Normally all searches are done ignoring case. With this mode
Xset, only strings which exactly match the search string, including case,
Xare matched.
X
X- GOTO line command
X
X	The goto-line (<ESC> G) command will go to a specific line
Xnumber of the file. For example to go to the 76th line of a file, type:
X
X	<ESC> 76 <ESC> G
X
X- Rename buffer
X
X	The command rename-buffer (<ESC> ^N) allows you to change the
Xname of the current buffer.
X
X- Paragraph movement
X
X	The forward-paragraph (<ESC> N) and previous-paragraph (<ESC> P)
Xcommands allow movement from one paragraph to another.
X
X- nasty algorith fixed....
X
X	A rather nasty algorithm in the kill buffer processing got
Xrewritten which ends up reducing the speed neeeded to wipe large areas
Ximmensly. This may have appeared to lock up the machine on the older
Xversions when a large wipe was attempted.
X
X- Header files rearranged
X
X	ESTRUCT.H	Structure and option declarations
X	EDEF.H		Global and external variable declarations
X	EPATH.H		Help and startup file paths
X	EFUNC.H		Name binding table
X	EBIND.H		Initial key binding tables
X
X- Paragraph filling!!
X
X	The fill-paragraph (<ESC> Q) command reformats the current
Xparagraph filling to the fill column as possible. Very handy....
X
X- Long lines
X
X	Lines longer than the screen now scroll right-left as you move
Xthrough them. Seeing what your editing is a big improvement.
X
X- word move and deletes
X
X	Due to massive demand by my users here, I have changed the way
Xword move and delete work so that they are more consistant and usefull.
XBut this change is configurable by changing the value of the NFWORD
Xconstant in ESTRUCT.H
X
X- View flag on command line
X
X	-v on the command line causes the editor to read a file in with
XVIEW mode set on. -e (edit) is the opposite causing it to read in for
Xediting (which is also the default).
X
X- Quick EXIT has done a quick change....
X
X	(sorry....) Quick-exit now writes out all changed buffers before
Xexiting.
X
X- Very long file lines
X
X	Very long lines (>255 chars) being read from a file now get
Xwrapped on multiple lines (instead of simple refusing to read any more
Xof the file as before) The user is warned about them with a message at
Xthe end of the read.
X
X- Space not clearing messages
X
X	Many of my users complained about the space not inserting itself
Xafter a message (it just cleared the message line). This is now
Xconfiguable in ESTRUCT.H
X
X- HELP commands!
X
X	the describe-key (^X ?) command allows the user to type in one
Xcommand and the editor echos back the command name bound to that key.
XThe help (<ESC> ?) command grabs the top window (or splits if if not
Xthere) and reads in the EMACS.HLP file. The list of places to look for
Xthe help file are in EPATH.H
X
X- View file command
X
X	View-file (^X ^V) is the same as find-file (old visit-file)
Xexcept it leaves the found file in VIEW mode.
X
X- Improved updating
X
X	On the systems that code has been written for, the screen update
Xroutines will defer updating if there is type ahead present. This makes
Xall movement commands much more pleasant. The code for this is in the
Xfunction typahead() in TERMIO.C. This is currently implimented for
XMSDOS, BSD4.2 and possible the AMIGA (Some one please check this out. I
Xonly have limited access to an AMIGA)
X
X- Buffer lists
X
X	are now alphabetically maintained.
X
X- Insert file
X
X	Insert-file (^X ^I) allows you to insert the contents of a file
Xat the current position of the current buffer. very useful
X
X- Scroll next window
X
X	Scroll-next-down (<ESC> ^V) and scroll-next-up (<ESC> ^Z) allow
Xyou to scroll the next window up and down by pages.
X
X- Arguments to searches
X
X	All searches and replaces now take a preceding numeric argument
Xto say how many times, rather than all the way to the bottom of the
Xfile.
X
X- Binding keys
X
X	The bind-to-key (^C) function allows you to change what
Xcommand a key invokes. It will promt you for a command name, and then a
Xkeystroke sequence. This is happy. Unbind-key (<ESC> ^C) allows you to
Xmake a key now longer have a function. (This is good when you accidently
Xbind <RET> or a letter to something)
X
X- Execute named command
X
X	Will prompt you for a command name, and then execute it. This
Xallows you to execute commands that are not currently bound to any keys.
X
X- Command name completion
X
X	Any time you are prompted for a command, if you type in part of
Xit and hit the space bar, the editor will try to finish it. If the bell
Xrighs, it means there is now command like what you are typing.
X
X- Describe bindings
X
X	Describe-bindings (not bound) will display a list of all the
Xcommands in a window (splitting if neccesary) and the keys bound with
Xthem. These will reflect the current bindings and not the default ones.
XThis is a good way to find out the name of a command you can't remember,
Xor which I picked a bad name for. (The names have been changed to
Xprotect the guilty (thats me) and are in EFUNC.H You too can change them
Xif you are into it).
X
X- Executing stuff
X
X	The execute-command-line command prompts you for a command line
Xon the bottom of the screen in the form:
X
X	{Numeric argument} <command-name> {<string arg> {<string arg>}}
X
X	(where {} are for optional stuff) and then executes it.
X
X	Execute-buffer executes a number of these commands in a buffer.
XIf any errors are found, the buffers current location will be set to the
Xbegining of the line with the error in it.
X
X	Execute-file will read a file into a buffer, execute it, and
Xthen kill the buffer if it executed to completion with no errors.
X
X- Startup file
X
X	MicroEMACS will attempt to execute a startup file (whose name is
Xin EPATH.H) on startup. The MSDOS name is EMACS.RC and under unix it is
Xusually .emacsrc
X
X- Multiple files on the command line
X
X	MicroEMACS will now except a list of files on the command line.
XThese files will all be assigned buffers, but will not be read in until
Xthe buffer is brought up in a window. -v and -e switches affect all the
Xfiles following them.
X
X- FILE LOCKING
X
X	This is for people on multi-user UNIX systems. What this feature
Xcan do is prevent two people from editing the same file and stomping on
Xeach others edits. Unfortunatly, the actually locking mechanism used
Xwhere I work is propritory so I could not send it out, but I have left
Xall the code (conditionally defined by the FILOCK symbol in ESTRUCT.H)
Xleading up to the actually locking routines so some one else can add it
Xwith little effort. Here are the comments for the actual routines that
Xneed to be added:
X
X/**********************
X *
X * dolock -- lock the file fname
X *
X * if successful, returns NULL 
X * if file locked, returns username of person locking the file
X * if other error, returns "LOCK ERROR: explanation"
X *
X *********************/
X
Xchar *dolock(fname)
X
Xchar *fname;	/* file name to be locked */
X
X
Xand
X
X
X/**********************
X *
X * undolock -- unlock the file fname
X *
X * if successful, returns NULL 
X * if other error, returns "LOCK ERROR: explanation"
X *
X *********************/
X
Xchar *undolock(fname)
X
Xchar *fname;		/* file name to unlock */
X
X
X	If some one wants to write these functions so they can be
Xdistributed publicly, please mail a separate file with them to me
Xand I will include them with these sources for others to use.
X
X- HP150 function/cursor key support
X
X	is now finished and working.

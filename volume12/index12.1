[  First I forgot the expiration date, then I made it Jan87.  I think
   I've finally got it right this time.  Sorry...  --r$  ]

This is the first of two introductory articles about comp.sources.unix.
This one describes how to submit source to the newsgroup, where the
archive sites are, and how to contact them.  The companion articles lists
all previously-published sources.

Due to my communication errors, the CSNET archives are out-of-date; this
will be fixed over the next few weeks.  Various French and other European
facilities for providing archive tapes should be available soon.  As an
experiment, I am putting 90-day expirations on these articles; if I post
new versions before the limit, I will send out a cancel message.

I am always looking for suggestions on how to improve the usefulness
of the newsgroup, and can be contacted as listed below.

Subject: Submitting source for publication

Items intended for posting or queries and problem notes should be sent to
uunet!sources.  In Australia, Robert Elz is a "sub-moderator"; people
there can work with him (kre@munnari.OZ) to get postings out more easily.

If you want verification of arrival, so say in a cover note, or at the
beginning of your submission, if it is small.  I try to verify that a
program works, and if I can't get it to work, I may hold up posting it
for a couple of days.  Please note that, except in rare cases, source
without documentation and a Makefile will not be published.  The backlog
from receipt to posting varies from one to four weeks depending mostly
on the set of submissions currently in my queue.

--------------------
Subject:  The structure of comp.sources.unix articles

Each posting in comp.sources.unix is called an "issue"; there are 100
issues to a volume.  The division is arbitrary, and has varied greatly in
the past.  There are two types of articles in comp.sources.unix; sources
and "information postings."  They can be distinguished by the subject
line:
	Subject:  v07INF8:  Index for Volume 7 and other info
This first word in the title identifies this as the eighth info posting of
volume seven.  Similarly, the subject line shown below:
	Subject:  v07i081:  Public-domain Unix kernel
identifies this as the 81st source article in Volume 7.  Large sources are
broken up into smaller pieces, and have subject lines that look like
this:
	Subject:  v07i082:  System VI Source Distribution, Part03/08

The first few lines of an article are auxiliary headers that look like this:

    Submitted-by: root@freeware.ATT.COM
    Posting-number: Volume 7, Issue 82
    Archive-name: new-login
The "Submitted by" is the author of the program.  If you have comments about
the sources published in comp.sources.unix, this is the person to contact.
When possible, this address is in domain form, otherwise it is a UUCP bang
path relative to some major site such as "uunet."

The second line repeats the volume/issue information for the aide of NOTES
sites and automatic archiving programs.

The Archive-name is the "official" name of this source in the archive.  Large
postings will have names that look like this:
    Archive-name: patch2/Part01
Please try to use this name when requesting that sources be mailed to you.
Also, note that the "part number" given in the title, and the archive name
given in the auxiliary header need not be identical.


--------------------
Subject: Accessing the archives

The complete archives are fairly large, running between three and four
megabytes per volume, on the average.

There are several active archive sites around the net.  Archive sites in
France and England are being set up, and may be extended to provide full
European coverage; I will post more information as soon as things are
settled.  Thanks to Scott Bradner at Harvard, there will soon be a BITNET
retrieval service available.

When you request something before Volume 6, please make sure to be as
descriptive as possible as articles before then do not have official
names.

Several sites below will send tapes through the mail.  For those sites,
send a 1/2" mag tape WITH RETURN POSTAGE and RETURN MAILER.  Tapes
without postage or mailer will not be returned.  No other methods (COD,
etc.) are available; please don't ask.

Finally, please note that I am Rich $alz, rsalz@uunet.uu.net; Rick Adams is
rick@seismo.css.gov, and Rich Kulawiec is rsk@j.cc.purdue.edu; we appreciate
the extra effort to get our names right.

Subject: Listing of archive sites in no particular order

1.   Chris Grevstad at Network Research is able to provide tape service in
     a variety of formats, including 1600BPI 9-track or NCR cartridge for
     TAR or CPIO, and ("under extereme duress" :-) VMS 9-track or TK-50
     tape.  He is willing to provide UUCP access by special arrangement in
     either the Oxnard, CA, or the Salt Lake City area.  Contact him at
     nrcvax!chris or via conventional mail at Network Research Corp., 2380
     North Rose Avenue, Oxnard CA 93030.

2.   Pyramid Technology has an archive arranged topically, and in compressed
     tar files.  They are happy to take new UUCP connections.  They are also
     somewhat willing to make tapes for people to come by and pick up,
     provided you call WELL in advance and bring lunch money.  This is being
     managed by Claudia Dimmers and/or Carl Gutekunst.  Contact
     pyramid!usenet for more info.

3.   Robert Elz (kre@munnari.OZ) keeps sources in different ways depending onU
     his available disk space; contact him for more info.

4.   Thos Sumner at UCSF will respond to requests for material, but cannot
     promise an ongoing commitment.  Anyone requesting material via mail
     should supply a path from ucbvax.  Anyone requesting tape should
     contact me first.  Contact him at thos@cca.ucsf.edu, or
     ucbvax!ucsfcgl!cca.UCSF!thos

6.   Michael Squires (sir-alan!mikes) of the Department of Political
     Science at Allegheny College has established an anonymous UUCP
     account that contains almost everything he has from mod.sources,
     net.sources, comp.sources.unix, and comp.sources.misc.  The following
     entry should work:
	     sir-alan Any ACU 2400 18143336728 login:--login:--login: pdsrc
     The modem is a Paradyne FDX 2400 which handles baud rate switching
     itself; 300/1200/2400 is supported. There is no access limit,
     although this will probably change.  The collection is not complete;
     a subject/filename listing can be found in the file
     /usr/spool/pdsrc/all.subjects.  Mike recently got a new disk and a
     full tape of the archives, so everything will be availalbe shortly.
     Mike can be reached at:  Department of Political Science, Allegheny
     College, Meadville PA 16335.

7.   Rick Adams (rick@uunet.uu.net) provides archive access to those on the
     Internet.  Access is available directly via anonymous FTP; look in
     ~ftp/comp.sources.unix/volumeN.  Rick and I have managed to work out
     an arrangement so that these archives are always current -- right as
     the sources are published.

8.   Internet sites may also retrieve archives from j.cc.purdue.edu via
     anonymous ftp.  The archive is in the directory
     ~ftp/news/comp/sources/unix/volumeX.  Due to disk space
     considerations, many of the sources are compressed; these may be
     recognized by the ".Z" suffix.  If you don't have compress & friends,
     they are in ~ftp/pub/compress.shar for the taking.  This is being
     managed by Rich Kulawiec (Wombat), pucc-j!rsk, rsk@j.cc.purdue.edu.
     If your host tables don't grok "j.cc.purdue.edu", try
     "purdue-asc.arpa".  They would appreciate it if you would avoid large
     file transfers in the middle of the day.  [Rick also points out that
     the FTP'able archies also contain mod.amiga, a bunch of kermit
     sources, news 2.11, rn 4.3, nntp, and whatever else happens to be in
     ~ftp/pub at the moment.]

9.   The CSNET CIC has been doing a fair amount of work to bring their
     automated retrieval up-to-speed.  They now have a complete archive,
     and are making things available as quickly as possible (they have
     special legal restrictions on what they can distribute, so everything
     may not be available).  Send a request for "mod.sources" with the
     topics "help" and "index" to the Info-Server, or or contact
     postmaster@sh.cs.net.

At the present time, I do not have ready access to the archives, nor
the support of my employer to do this.  Please don't ask me for missing
issues, unless you are sure you are reporting a net-wide problem of
propogation.

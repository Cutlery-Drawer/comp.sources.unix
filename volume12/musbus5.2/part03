XSystems (MUSBUS), has been developed
Xto assist in
X.IP (a)
Xidentifying bottlenecks and performance problems in new
XUNIX ports, and
X.IP (b)
Xproviding a robust test environment in which
Xthe performance of competing
XUNIX systems may be compared.
X.LP
XThis document provides an overview for \fBVersion\fP \fB5.0 (Beta)\fP of MUSBUS
Xand is intended for knowledgeable programmers trying to run
Xthe software on their own hardware.
X.NH 2 Preliminaries
X.NH 2.1 "Software Environment"
X.LP
XYou will require a system that supports Level 7, System V
Xor BSD
Xcompatibility, along with the following programs.
X.RS
X.PR sh
X(the Bourne shell)

X.PR awk
X.PR cat

X.NH 2.2 "Getting Started"
X.LP
XAll the files are distributed in a single directory.
XOnce these have been retrieved from the distribution some initial housekeeping
Xand system specifics have to be sorted out.
X.LP
XWhen fully installed, MUSBUS contains files in several subdirectories
Xas follows,
X.IP \(bu
X.FL Results ,
Xlog files created by the command procedure
X.PR run .
X.IP \(bu
X.FL Tmp ,
Xtemporary files created by
X.PR run
Xand friends.
X.IP \(bu
X.FL Tools ,
Xpost processors to produce
X.PR tbl
Xinput from the log files.
X.IP \(bu
X.FL Workload ,
Xdescriptions of the workload profile, all associated data files and some
Xwork script manipulation tools.
X.LP
XTo explicitly
Xcreate these directories and distribute the required files into the
Xappropriate places you may
X.SC "make install"
Xhowever this will be done automatically by
X.PR run
Xas required.
X.LP
XThe file 
X.FL time.awk
Xis used by the command procedure
X.PR run
Xto average the
Xresults from several attempts to time a particular test and so
Xdepends upon the format of output from
X.PR /bin/time .
XThe results from multiple timing attempts are held temporarily
Xin the file 
X.FL Tmp/tmp.$$
X(where $$ is the pid of the
X.PR run
Xshell).
XTry
X.SC "/bin/time date"
Xand check the output from
X.PR /bin/time .
XIf it has a format like
X.ti +4n
X0.4 real         0.0 user         0.1 sys  
X.br
Xthen
X.SC "rm -f time.awk"
X.SC "ln BSDtime.awk time.awk"
X.LP
XIf the
X.PR /bin/time
Xoutput looks like
X.RS
X.ta 8n
X.nf
Xreal	0:00.4
Xuser	0:00.0
Xsys	0:00.1
X.fi
X.RE
Xthen
X.SC "rm -f time.awk"
X.SC "ln SysVtime.awk time.awk"
X.LP
XOtherwise create your own version of
X.FL time.awk
Xusing
X.FL *time.awk
Xas examples.
X.LP
XSome of the tests require system calls from the C code to measure
Xsmall elapsed times.
XThis is a real problem since there appears to be no 
Xuniversally correct way of doing this in the Unix
Xworld.
XThe particular source files are
X.FL clock.c ,
X.FL fstime.c
Xand
X.FL mem.c .
XIn the
X.FL Makefile ,
Xensure that you have \fBone\fP of the following
Xdefinitions included in the CFLAGS (in addition to the \(miO).
X.RS
X.ta 12n
X.nf
X.if t \fH\s-1\(miDSysV\s+1\fP	you are using a System V brand of Unix
X.if n \(miDSysV	you are using a System V brand of Unix
X.if t \fH\s-1\(miDBSD4v2\s+1\fP	you are using a Berkeley 4.2 or 4.3 system
X.if n \(miDBSD4v2	you are using a Berkeley 4.2 or 4.3 system
X.if t \fH\s-1\(miDBSD4v1\s+1\fP	you are using a Berkeley 4.1 system
X.if n \(miDBSD4v1	you are using a Berkeley 4.1 system
X.fi
X.RE
XFor example,
X.ti +6n
X.if t \fH\s-1CFLAGS = \(miO \(miDBSD4v2\s+1\fP
X.if n CFLAGS = -O -DBSD4v2
X.LP
XIf \fBnone\fP of these systems
Xis appropriate, the source files \fIwill not compile\fP
Xand you will have to decide on appropriate alternative calls
Xand coding to suit local conditions.
X.LP
XCheck the
X.FL HISTORY
Xfile (if it exists) for notification of any changes, additions
Xor problems that may have been made or fixed subsequent to the version
Xof MUSBUS described in this document.
X.LP
XTry
X.SC "make programs"
Xto confirm that every necessary program can be compiled and
Xloaded correctly.
X.LP
XNow attempt to run all the tests once (this takes roughly 20 minutes).
XUsing the Bourne shell (\c
X.PR /bin/sh ),
X.SC "iterations=1"
X.SC "nusers=1"
X.SC "export iterations nusers"
X.SC "./run"
X.LP
XThis should demonstrate
Xthat all the 
X.PR sh,
X.PR awk,
X.PR sed
Xand 
X.PR ed
Xscripts
Xcan be made to work.
XVerification of the health of things to this point depends upon
Xchecking the output from
X.PR run
Xto ensure that no nasty errors
Xare reported, and in particular scrolling through the file
X.FL Results/log .
XEvery time
X.PR run
Xis used information is \f3appended\fP to
X.FL Results/log
Xand
X.FL Results/log.work ,
Xso make sure that these files are removed or renamed before you start
Xto do anything serious.
XThe contents of
X.FL Results/log

X.LP
XOther possible error reports in

Xrelate to specific tests
Xand are either self explanatory (e.g. missing or illegal program
Xoptions) or described in the Sections below.
X.LP
XThe file
X.FL Results/log.work
Xcontains detailed logging of the multi-user test, and may contain
Xuseful information in the event that this test fails or terminates
Xprematurely.
XBesides logging process ids and file descriptor assignments for each
Xsimulated user's job stream, standard error output is trapped and
Xreported in
X.FL Results/log.work .
X.NH 3 "The Tests"
X.LP
XIf you are serious about the results produced, these tests should
Xbe run on a dedicated system without concurrent activity.
XWhen possible, an idle system in mult-iuser mode is
Xpreferable to a single user system.
X.LP
XAll the tests are controlled by shell variables used within the command
Xprocedure
X.PR run .
XBy setting environment variables of the same name, the default values
Xof the shell variables
Xmay be over-ridden, however if the defaults are consistently wrong for
Xparticular variables it is safer (i.e. less error prone) to modify
Xthe defaults in
X.PR run .
X.LP
X.PR Run
Xdoes its work for the most part silently, logging information to
Xcertain files, and providing a terse summary of the particular test(s)
Xbeing run on the tty from which
X.PR run
Xwas invoked.
X.LP
XA designated test may by run using the command
X.SC "./run thing"
Xwhere \fIthing\fP is one of the test names described in the following
XSections.
XThe commands
X.SC "./run"
Xor
X.SC "./run all"
Xwill run everything.
X.LP
X.PR Run
Xmay be interrupted from the keyboard (SIGINT)
Xif it is started in foreground
Xand after some fooling about it manages to shut things down and clean up files.
X.PR run
Xcreates a 
X.PR sh
Xcommand procedure
X.FL Tmp/kill_run
Xthat may be used to shut down a background
X.PR run
Xvia
X.SC "Tmp/kill_run"
X.VA iterations 6
XUnless otherwise stated,
Xthis variable controls the number of times each test is repeated for timing.
XAt the beginning of each iteration, the program
X.FL iamalive
Xwrites the iteration
Xnumber (without newline or carriage return)
Xon standard output.
X.NH 3.1 "Raw Speed Measures"
X.NH 3.1.1 "Specific Arithmetic"
X.LP
XThis family of tests computes the sum of a series of terms
Xsuch that the arithmetic is unbiased towards operator type
X(i.e. equal numbers of additions, subtractions, multiplications
Xand divisions).
XEach major loop in the computation involves summing 100 terms
Xof the series.
X.VA arithloop 1000
XNumber of major loops in the computation.
X.TN arithoh
XDo not compute the series, so measures the overhead in the
Xcomputation.
X.TN register
XArithmetic uses registers.
X.TN short
XArithmetic uses shorts.
X.TN int
XArithmetic uses ints.
X.TN long
XArithmetic uses longs.
X.TN float
XArithmetic uses floats.
X.TN double
XArithmetic uses doubles.
X.LP
XAfter all the arithmetic tests have been performed, the 
X.PR sh
Xscript
X.FL Tools/Adjust
Xshould be used with
X.FL Results/log ,
Xi.e.
X.SC "./Tools/Adjust Results/log"
Xto compute the \fBactual\fP
XCPU and elapsed times when the overhead measured by the test
X.PR arithoh
Xis subtracted.
XIt is these times (i.e. \fIminus the startup and loop overhead\fP)
Xthat have been published and circulated amongst MUSBUS users.
XFailure to run the 
X.PR Tools/Adjust
Xscript will make the machine
Xyou are testing look comparatively worse
Xthan it really is!
XNote that
X.PR Tools/Adjust
Xwill be run automatically by the log file postprocessors (\c
X.PR Tools/mktbl
Xand
X.PR Tools/mkcomp )
Xif the times have not already been adjusted.
XOnce the adjustment has been made, the relevant portion of

Xper iteration.
XThe system calls (\c
X.PR dup (0),
X.PR close (i),
X.PR getpid (),
X.PR getuid ()
Xand
X.PR umask (i))
Xinvolve little work on the part of the UNIX kernel, so
Xthe test predominantly measures the overhead associated with
Xthe system call mechanism.

Xa 512 byte block along a pipe
X.SV io
Xtimes.

Xthe child process to exit (which it should do immediately).
X.VA nexecl 100
X.TN execl
XPerform
X.SV nexecl
Xexecs using 
X.PR execl ().
XThe program to be exec'd has been artificially expanded to a reasonable
Xsize (on a VAX, 11264 text + 2048 data + 24388 bss).
X.VA switch1 500
X.TN context1
XPerform 2 x
X.SV switch1
Xcontext switches, using pipes for synchronization.
XThe test involves 2 processes connected via 2 pipes.
XOne process writes then reads a 4-byte (descending) sequence number, while
Xthe other process reads then writes a sequence number.
XSynchronization is validated at each swap by checking the values of the
Xsequence numbers read and written.
X.NH 3.1.5 "C Compilation and Loading"
X.TN C
XMeasure the time for each of
X.SC "cc -c cctest.c"
X.SC "cc cctest.o"
Xwhere 
X.FL cctest.c
Xcontains 124 lines of uninteresting C code (108
Xlines of real code after 
X.PR cpp ).
X.NH 3.1.6 "Memory Access Speed"
X.LP
XThese tests try to measure read accesses per real second into an array
Xof integers.
XBecause of inaccuracies in measuring small real times, the
Xresults of this test are subject to large variances and
Xcan not be interpreted with great confidence (e.g. negative
Xand infinite speeds have been observed).
XConsequently, these tests are best considered as a
Xhistorical curiosities from the days when MMUs were bottlenecks on
Xmicroporcessor-based systems, and \fBno\fP real significance should
Xbe attached to the observed times.
X.VA poke 100000
XNumber of array accesses.
X.VA arrays "8 64 512"
XList of array sizes in units of 1024 ints.
X.TN seqmem
XCyclic sequential access pattern, hitting each element of the array
Xin turn.
X.TN randmem
XRandom access patterns -- to give VM systems a chance to do something
Xbetter!
X.NH 3.1.7 "Filesystem Throughput"
X.VA blocks "62 125 250 500"
XA list of file sizes in Kbytes.
X.VA where .
XThe directory in which the files will be created.
XThis test requires at least
X2 x max(\c
X.SV blocks )
XKbytes of free space in the filesystem
Xcontaining
X.SV where .
X.TN fstime
XThis program attempts to measure file write time, file read time and
Xfile copy time.
XIt is assumed that BUFSIZ as defined in <stdio.h> is a good size for
Xphysical i/o, and all i/o is done via direct calls to 
X.PR read ()
Xand 
X.PR write ().
XThis test is performed (\c
X.SV iterations /2)
Xtimes.
X.LP
XBeware of the \fIwrite\fP time, since this can be influenced by the size
Xof the disk block cache in the kernel.
XBefore the reads are commenced there are a couple of 
X.PR sync ()s
Xand a 5 second sleep to try and flush the cache.
XThe times for small files are most sensitive to disk block
Xcaching.
X.LP
XReally the \fIcopy\fP time for the largest file
Xis the best indicator of throughput and reflects
Xthe type of disk activity most commonly generated by compilers, editors,
Xassemblers, etc.
XAlso the rates are measured against elapsed time, so there is some
Xscope for variance however the absolute times are usually long enough
Xto make this effect insignificant \fBprovided\fP
Xthere is no concurrent disk activity on the same spindle!
X.NH 3.2 "Emulated Multi-user Test"
X.VA nusers "1 4 8 16 24 32"
XA list of the number users to be emulated.
X.VA ttys /dev/tty
XA \fBlist\fP of tty devices
Xwhere the simulated tty output is sent -- there is a lot of this, and
Xyou should ensure that these tty lines are operating at the normal
Xbaud rate (e.g. 9600) for the test system.
XIf your CPU console does not use a standard serial multiplexer
X(e.g. a VAX, Pyramid, Gould, DG, etc.), then the tty output
Xshould be directed to \fIsome other\fP tty line(s) that \fBdo\fP use the
Xordinary serial port hardware.
X.VA dirs Tmp

Xand temporary files to run the
Xuser job streams from.
X.VA rate 2

X.NH 6 "Caveat Emptor"
X.LP
XThe MUSBUS tests have been widely distributed, and in some cases
Xtheir owners have not treated them kindly.
XThe following list details known pitfalls in running the tests
Xand the subsequent application of the results.
X.IP (1)
XThere are several versions of the test suite, Version 3.3 (and later
Xversions) in particular
Xare very different to earlier versions and results obtained
Xwith different versions of the suite cannot be meaningfully
Xcompared.
XI make no claim for the long-term
Xstability of MUSBUS, and so this evolutionary
Xprocess is likely to continue with future releases of the test suite.
X.IP (2)
XThere is \fBno\fP reason to suspect that the distributed workload
Xfor the multi-user test (i.e. the files
X.FL Tmp/script.?
Xand
X.FL Tmp/workload )
Xare representative of the user work profile at \fByour\fP installation(s).
XBe prepared to alter or rebuild the workload to reflect your
Xexpected system usage.
X.IP (3)
XResults have been known to vary
Xdramatically between releases of the UNIX you
Xare testing.
XThis reflects vendor tuning (sometimes breaking) of the UNIX port
Xand MUSBUS is a useful diagnostic tool in this area, provided the
XMUSBUS version and workload profile remain fixed.
X.IP (4)
XPoints (1) to (3) suggest that uncontrolled and uninformed
Xcomparisons of
XMUSBUS results is dangerous in the extreme.
XThis is the main reason that I have not published the large
Xcollection of results accumulated to date.
X.IP (5)
XRemember that the tests described in Section 3.1 are intended
Xfor \fBdiagnostic\fP use.
XIf you are interested in \fBperformance\fP, you should focus
Xupon the multi-user test described in Section 3.2.
X.IP (6)
XBeware of simulating \fBtoo few\fP users in the multi-user
Xtest.
XUseful information about system throughput and performance
Xunder heavy load conditions can usually be obtained by
Xextrapolation of various measures computed from the
XCPU and elapsed times for the multi-user tests with
Xvarious numbers of users.
XHowever this assumes the machine has been sufficiently loaded to
Xmove out of the \fIlinear\fP part of the performance curves.
XFor very fast machines, this may require emulation of
Xa \fIlarge\fP number of users in the multi-user test.
X.IP (7)
XBeware of simulating \fBtoo many\fP users in the multi-user
Xtest.
XUsing the default value for
X.SV ttys ,
X\fBall\fP simulated
Xtty output is directed to a \fIsingle\fP serial port.
XAs you increase the number of simulated users in the multi-user
Xtest (in response to Point (6) above) the serial port
Xbandwidth may become the limiting resource!
XThis is easy to fix by adding a list of more tty devices to the 
Xvalue of
X.SV ttys .
X.IP (8)
XBe warned that the multi-user test has ``broken'' several UNIX
Xports.
XCauses have been identified as implementation (configuration)
Xlimits in the system being tested (e.g. proc slots), real
Xbugs in the port or MUSBUS errors.
XThis list is basically in order of decreasing probability.
X.LP
XCommunication on MUSBUS experiences is welcomed at the
Xelectronic addresses on the first page of this document.
XIf you have found a problem, or can suggest a better testing
Xtechnique please let me know, so that future versions might
Xoffer real (as opposed to cosmetic) enhancements.

XA new text processing workload profile for users that use vi rather
Xthan ed.  Requires BSD4.X or similar for pseudo ttys.
X
XTo configure this test properly, check
X(a) ../map_pty does the correct things in mapping an ordinal user number onto
X    a valid pty name.
X(b) Edit the file ttytype (``make ttytype'' to create a prototype if it
X    doesn't already exist) to include the termcap (terminfo?) names of the
X    terminal types attached to the tty devices you are going to use.
X(c) Be aware that each simulated user requires dedicated access to a pty,
X    so this will typically limit the maximum number of simulated users.

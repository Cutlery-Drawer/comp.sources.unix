# This is a shell archive, meaning:
# 1. Remove everything above the #! /bin/sh line.
# 2. Save the resulting text in a file.
# 3. Execute the file with /bin/sh (not csh) to create:
#	README
#	diff

XThis directory contains a diff for a modified version of the lex driver
X(ncform). It is not absolutely necessary to cake: the only difference
Xis in error detection. If you cannot or do not want to install this diff
Xto ncform, (e.g. cause you have an unsymphatetic root or you are worried
Xabout AT&T's copyright on the original ncform, of which this one is a
Xsmall modification), you should keep the calls to and the definition of
Xcheck_actlen in cake_s.l; otherwise you should comment them out.

XCatching lex buffer overflows is important. Some cake actions, like
Xmake actions, are very long, but this may not be apparent, as this
Xlength would almost certainly result from macro expansion (a link
Xcommand for a large system can easily reach hundreds of bytes).
XAn overflow like this, if it occurs, leads to core dump, and the bug
Xcan be VERY HARD to track down. I know, I spent a week on it once.

Subject: [ef]?grep -- about the next two (sharfile) messages
Status: RO

egrep.shar.1 is 56129 bytes; it contains [ef]?grep code and documentation.

egrep.shar.2 is 55583 bytes; it contains henry spencer's regexp() routines
   -- it's not any different than what's already in the archive.

i'm sending you both so you can just say

	sh egrep.shar.1
	sh egrep.shar.2
	make
	sh eg.shell

to test it out (bsd 4.3 people are instructed to apply a diff to go full
bore with the -i option).

now, if you choose not to re-post shar.2, the make assumes regexp() source
is in the same directory as [ef]?grep source.  of course, folks will have
to piece together the three regexp() fixes together with the orig. from
the archive if it's not re-posted, or mail to hoptoad!gnu for a newer one.

the only tricky thing about the egrep.shar.1 is that the application of 'sh'
will run some 'tr' commands at the end (see last few lines) to change two
files (k.pat & k.test) in the sharchive, so any re-packaging you do *must*
contain these commands.  they "translit" some parity-marked bytes of japanese
kanji for tests -- if i included the files raw, the mailers (to you or to
the net) choke, and besides, i can't assume people are running the korn shell
which deals correctly with eight-bit chars to unshar things.

it's the only way i know to send parity bytes without assuming the existence
of the improbable, or at least 'encode/decode'.

the best way for you is to keep egrep.shar.1 intact, or re-shar only after
preserving/cutting/pasting "k.pat/k.test" from the original.

my work phone is (415) 694-6436.

sincerely,

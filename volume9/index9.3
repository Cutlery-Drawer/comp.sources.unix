Subject:  v09INF3:  Change in archive sites, recent errors
Newsgroups: mod.sources
Approved: rs@mirror.TMC.COM

Submitted by: Rich $alz <mirror!rs>
Mod.sources: Volume 9, Info 3
Archive-name: index9.3

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		UPDATE TO ARCHIVE SITES
The full list of archive sites, and the services they provide, were
given in first Volume 9 index article, posted near the beginning of
the month.  The next few paragraphs provide some recent updates.

The "anonymous UUCP" access to mod.sources maintained by the people at
cuae2 has been abolished.  People there no longer feel it is in their
interest to provide the free UUCP login.

David Barto has an automated mail-based retrieval system.  To retrieve
send a mail message to megatek!sources.  The body of the message should
be the word "BEGIN" on a line by itself, the names of the files to
retrieve, the word "END", then a short return address to your site.
The special string "LIST" will send the currently accessable list of
sources.  David is reachable as megatek!barto.

Jim Thompson, otto!jim, can also make quarter-inch tar and cpio tapes
for people -- contact him for more details.

CSNET sites can retrieve postings from the CSNET Info-Server.  To
receive help and an index, send the following request:
		Request: mod.sources
		Topic: help
		Topic: index

Thanks to Scott Bradner at Harvard, there will soon be a BITNET
retrieval service available.  There will also be tape-based archive
service for European sites.

NOTE:  There is *no* automated retrieval system running at Mirror
Systems.  Please do not send terse, computer-oriented, messages to
mirror!sources-request -- that alias is read by a human, not a
machine.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
		RECENT PROBLEMS
Some strange problems on mirror (a bad disk block?) have lead to
corruptions in the following postings:
	Ease (early truncation)
	Elm (Configure.sh and one source file)
	Month (one part missing)
Re-posts for the damaged parts are going out over the next couple of
days.

		NO MORE EDITORS
At times this newsgroup can be accused of having become mod.sources.editors.
I am calling for a hiatus on full-screen editor postings for the next
several months or so, maybe even for a full year.  Before you submit
an editor to me for publication, please check with me -- and your code --
that it does something substantively different from the following editors
already available in the mod.sources archive;
    Volume 4: uEmacs (6 parts) MicroEmacs, v. 30
    Volume 4: uEmacs3.6 (8 parts) MicroEMACS 3.6
    Volume 4: TVX (10 parts) Portable editor, with "emacs" and "vi" modes
    Volume 4: se (8 parts) Georgia Tech 'se' screen editor
    Volume 6: MicroEmacs, Version 3.7 (uEmacs3.7); 12 parts
    Volume 8: Georgia Tech 'se' Screen Editor; 7 parts
    Volume 8: A Micro-Emacs variant that resembles GNU Emacs; 11 parts
    Volume 8: The JOVE text editor; 13 parts
    Volume 9: A TECO text editor; 4 parts
    Volume 9: MicroEMACS, version 3.8b; 14 parts
(Thanks to rsk@j.cc.purdue.edu for pointing this out.)
